## We may safely infer...

Judging from the past, we may safely infer that no one living species will transmit its unaltered likeness to a distant futurity. And of the species now living very few will transmit progeny of any kind to a far distant futurity.

_Charles Darwin, On the Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection, or The Preservation Of Favoured Race In The Struggle For Life (1859)_
