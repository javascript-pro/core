#### Context

> Judging from the past, we may safely infer that no one piece of software (sic) will transmit its unaltered likeness to a distant futurity. And of the software now being used very little will transmit ideas of any kind to a far distant futurity

[Charles Darwin](https://goldlabel.pro/balance/sci-fi/charles-darwin), On the Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection, or The Preservation Of Favoured Race In The Struggle For Life (1859)
