## Best price (noun)

The universal truth: if it costs nothing, it’s already worth more than you were planning to spend.

#### Usage

- "How much was that? — Free. — Best price."
- "I wasn’t even looking, but if it’s free, I’ll take three."

Connotations:
✨ Feels like winning a game you didn’t know you were playing
✨ Better than half-price, better than 90% off
✨ The one number that makes everyone suddenly interested
