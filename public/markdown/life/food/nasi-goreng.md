> **Nasi Goreng** is an Indonesian dish made from leftover rice stir-fried with garlic, shallots, chilli, and sweet soy sauce (kecap manis). Often enriched with prawns, chicken, or beef. Usually finished with prawn crackers a fried egg and a side of crisp cucumber

This is something I've made for over 20 years and it's different every time. If you want to recreate authentically trad Nasi Goreng from scratch, follow these steps

First have a chinese the night before. There's always some berk who's ordered too much rice and nobody likes cold boily rice hanging round the fridge
