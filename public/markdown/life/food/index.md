You want a recipe? The interweb's full of them. This is how I cook. This is why I cook.

If you find something, good. If not — well, maybe you were hungry for something else.

When I want a recipe I go the internet of course. I get annoyed by the amount of adverts on the pages where I want to follow simple instructions.

For some recipes that I've tried & tested I've stripped them down and added them here. Sometimes they've been tweaked a little or translated from silly ounces to sensible grams.
