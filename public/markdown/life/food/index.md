> You want a recipe? The interweb's full of them. This is how I cook

[PageGrid pages="/life/food/air-fried-peppers, /life/food/banana-bread, /life/food/beef-wellie, /life/food/lemon-meringue-pie"]

If you find something that works for you, good. If not — well, maybe you were hungry for something else. When I want a recipe I go the internet of course. I get annoyed by the amount of adverts on the pages where I want to follow simple instructions. For some recipes that I've tried & tested I've stripped them down and turned them into content. Sometimes they've been tweaked a little or translated from silly ounces to sensible grams.
