> Cixin Liu is significant because he brought Chinese hard sci-fi to a global audience, blending rigorous physics, grand cosmic scale, and philosophical depth. His work revitalised hard sci-fi worldwide, won major awards (including the Hugo), and introduced a distinctly non-Western perspective to the genre’s biggest ideas.

Best known for The Three-Body Problem and its sequels, collectively The Remembrance of Earth’s Past.
