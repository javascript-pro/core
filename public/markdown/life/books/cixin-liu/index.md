> Cixin Liu is a Chinese science-fiction writer best known for The Three-Body Problem and its sequels, collectively The Remembrance of Earth’s Past.

## The Three-Body Problem

First contact begins when scientists discover an alien civilisation on the unstable planet Trisolaris. Humanity becomes divided over whether to resist or welcome them.

## The Dark Forest

Earth prepares for the coming Trisolaran invasion. The “Dark Forest Theory” reveals why the universe seems silent—and why contact between civilisations is terrifyingly dangerous.

## Death’s End

The conflict escalates to cosmic scales. Dimensional warfare, universe-changing technology, and the ultimate fate of humanity and the cosmos come into play.

Cixin Liu is significant because he brought Chinese hard sci-fi to a global audience, blending rigorous physics, grand cosmic scale, and philosophical depth. His work revitalised hard sci-fi worldwide, won major awards (including the Hugo), and introduced a distinctly non-Western perspective to the genre’s biggest ideas.
