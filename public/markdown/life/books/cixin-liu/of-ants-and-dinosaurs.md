> Cixin Liu is a Chinese science-fiction writer best known for The Three-Body Problem and its sequels, collectively The Remembrance of Earth’s Past.

Of Ants and Dinosaurs works as a sharp, playful satire, but unlike Orwell’s Animal Farm, it doesn’t age in the same way. Orwell tied his allegory tightly to a specific political moment; once you understand the Russian Revolution and early-Soviet power struggles, the book’s targets feel fixed in time. Its punch is still there, but its scope is narrow.

Cixin’s novella aims wider. By pairing two wildly different species in a forced symbiosis, he sidesteps topical politics and goes straight for the structural problems of civilisation itself — cooperation, dependency, exploitation, and technological hubris. Because the setup isn’t bound to a particular regime or historical incident, the satire stays fresh. The ants and dinosaurs become stand-ins for any imbalanced partnership: governments and technocrats, capital and labour, humanity and its tools.

The tone is lighter, almost whimsical, but the critique lands harder precisely because it isn’t pinned to one era. It’s about how societies drift into catastrophe when mutual benefit becomes one-sided, and how intelligence without humility accelerates collapse. That makes it feel more durable than Animal Farm — less a snapshot of a political moment, more a fable about the recurring patterns of civilisation.
