## Design Templates

Thanks for the feedback! Since Berry is more admin/dashboard-oriented, let's pivot to front-facing templates that still use MUI, focusing on navigation, page structure, and content display.

Here are a few front-facing options that may fit your needs:

### **1. Materially React Gatsby Landing Page Template**
   - Built with MUI components.
   - Ideal for front-facing business or product websites with well-organized, multi-page navigation.
   - Features include a clean homepage, about, services, blog, and contact pages.
   - Focuses on static information and easy-to-consume content without dashboards or heavy animations.

### **2. Jumbo Front (by WrapPixel)**
   - A professional front-end React template with Material UI.
   - Multi-page layout: includes home, services, pricing, blog, and contact sections.
   - Emphasis on content clarity and structured layout.

### **3. Skote (React Material UI)**
   - A React template with a balance of modern and minimal design.
   - Responsive multi-page site with sections for products, blog, documentation, and company info.
   - Prioritizes clear navigation and organized content hierarchy.

### **4. Custom Template Approach**
   If none of the existing templates perfectly match, we can start from an MUI starter template and customize it for your needs:
   - **Base MUI Template:** Modify the default template with multi-page support and components like the `AppBar`, `Drawer`, and `Grid`.
   - I can help structure a skeleton that includes an `AppBar` with navigation links and dynamic page content.

Let me know which route youâ€™d like to explore! I can also create a custom base template with MUI tailored to your requirements.
