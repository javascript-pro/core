I’ve been diving for over 25 years. I’m not an instructor, and I don’t dive every weekend — but it’s something that’s been part of my life for a long time. I trained as a PADI Divemaster (though my cert’s lapsed now), and even if I’m not guiding anyone these days, the underwater world still feels good. Nice & quiet.
