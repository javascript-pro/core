This section of the site is a quiet space for sharing some of the places I’ve been, the gear I’ve trusted, and the small moments I remember best — that sound when you first descend, the feeling of hovering, the shift in time when you're deep and weightless.

Diving’s not a job for me. It’s not even a hobby I talk about much. But it’s one of the constants. So if you're into that world too — or just curious — you’re very welcome here.
