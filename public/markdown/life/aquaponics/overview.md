What: Aquaponics is a sustainable farming method that combines aquaculture (raising fish) and hydroponics (growing plants without soil) in a closed-loop system.

Who: Ideal for urban growers, hobbyists, educators, and anyone interested in eco-friendly food production.

Where: Can be set up almost anywhereâ€”indoors, in greenhouses, on rooftops, or in backyards.

When: Aquaponics can be practiced year-round with the right setup and climate control.

Why: It uses less water than traditional farming, produces both protein and vegetables, and creates a self-sustaining ecosystem.
