Apps need state management — or you'd be right back in jQuery callback hell. And nobody wants that.

**Uberedux** is a simple, zero-config wrapper around Redux. It plugs cleanly into how the app already works and gives you the global state access you need without boilerplate or fuss.

There’s nothing clever here — and that’s the point. It’s fast, familiar, and already done for you.
