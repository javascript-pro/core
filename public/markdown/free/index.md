##  Some things in life _are_ free — Goldlabel [Core](/free/core) is one of them.

This is the foundation for everything we do. It’s fully open source, under active development, and freely available to use, fork, break, or build on. If you’re the kind of developer who likes digging under the hood, this is where the engine lives.

We’re not trying to hide anything behind paywalls or pitch decks. If you want to see how we build things, just open the repo. If you want to get involved, even better — we’re always looking for the right kind of collaborator.
