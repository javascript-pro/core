## Applying for jobs can be time consuming

Each role requires tailoring a cover letter or rewording a CV to match a job description. As developers, we know the real problem isn’t effort — it’s clarity. Am I a good fit? Is this worth my time?

Goldlabel Apps set out to solve this by creating a tool that does one thing well:
Given a CV and a job description, tell me whether the match is good — and why.

### Agile Story

> As a job seeker or recruiter, I want to quickly assess how well a CV matches a job description, so that I can focus my time on roles or candidates that are a good fit.

### Implementation

We built a lightweight AI-powered web app using Next.js and OpenAI's GPT-4 API. Users paste in their CV (in Markdown) and the job description. The app generates a structured fit analysis in natural language.

- A toggle allows switching between first-person and third-person voice.
- A streaming UI provides instant feedback as the model thinks.
- Recruiters or job seekers can copy the result as plain text for outreach.

We also added a simple retry mechanism and logic to detect when a user accidentally pastes code instead of a job description.

### Outcome

The tool reduces friction in job applications. Recruiters can check fit without reading the entire CV. Candidates save time and gain clarity when choosing roles to pursue. As a real tool and example project, it demonstrates our ability to ship.

### Reflection

This feature started as a demo and turned into something genuinely useful. It’s now part of our app, not just as a portfolio piece — but as a working tool we use ourselves.
