## Fullstack JavaScript Developer

Over 20 years of experience delivering scalable web applications across startups, enterprises, and remote-first teams in the UK, Europe, and Australia and beyond. Deep expertise in React, TypeScript, current specialising in Next.js.

Recently, I’ve focused on using AI as a practical development accelerator — not a shortcut, but a force multiplier. With experience and intent, AI generates production-grade results faster and cleaner. Code now ships 2–3x faster with fewer bugs.

Proven track record building high-performance UIs, integrating automated testing and linting, and delivering through streamlined pipelines. Equally comfortable leading projects or collaborating in agile teams. Prefer a clear brief, a clean codebase, and a culture that values delivery. Outside work, I write, travel, surf, dive, and ski.
