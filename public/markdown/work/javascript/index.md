## JavaScript Whatever the Weather

We’ve been writing JavaScript since it was still called ECMAScript.

Before the frameworks, before npm, before it ate the world—we were already deep in the language that powers the modern web.

We’ve built Flash apps in ActionScript.  
We’ve written jQuery plugins by hand.  
We’ve moved through Vanilla JS, React, and beyond.  
We’ve worked in Node.js since 2006.

And through it all, one thing has remained constant: _JavaScript runs the show_.

### It Was Always JavaScript

Even when it wasn’t.

- _ActionScript?_ Flash’s scripting language was basically JavaScript with a stricter compiler.
- _jQuery?_ That was us hiding from browser inconsistencies—but it was still JavaScript underneath.
- _React?_ Just a way of writing better JavaScript components.
- _Node?_ JavaScript on the server. A game changer.

We’ve used it for UI, logic, APIs, real-time systems, build tooling, browser extensions, PWAs, even art projects.

If it runs JavaScript, we’ve probably shipped something on it.

### What We Offer

We provide JavaScript development services across the full stack:

- _Frontend_  
  React, Next.js, Vanilla JS, MUI, custom UIs, performance tuning

- _Backend_  
  Node.js, Express, Firebase Functions, serverless APIs, file pipelines

- _Tooling & Ops_  
  Turborepos, CI/CD, linters, custom bundlers, markdown pipelines

- _Legacy to Modern_  
  Converting Flash/ActionScript or jQuery codebases to modern stacks

- _Custom Libraries_  
  We write clean, documented libraries that solve real-world problems

Everything we do is typed, testable, and built to last.

### JavaScript Is Home

It’s the language we reach for first.

Not because it’s trendy—but because we know it inside out. We’ve seen the patterns, the pitfalls, and the possibilities. We know where the bodies are buried.

If you need a JavaScript team that’s battle-tested, precise, and fast—we’re here.
