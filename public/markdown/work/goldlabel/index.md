#### Open Source Platform

It’s the public GitHub repository that powers goldlabel.pro — and it’s free for anyone to fork, copy, hack, and reuse.

#### What is it?

Goldlabel is a JavaScript platform built with:

- Next.js – modern React framework for the web
- React – component-driven architecture
- Material UI – clean, accessible, and customizable UI components

Everything you see on this production site is built from Goldlabel. It’s the full set of building blocks, ready to be adapted to your own projects.

#### Why Use Goldlabel?

- Open & Free – No lock-in. Take what you need, remix the rest.
- Production-Ready – The exact codebase that runs our live site.
- Cartridges – Modular units of functionality that can be dropped in or swapped out.
- Community-Friendly – Fork it, contribute back, or use it as inspiration.

#### Get Started

1. Clone or fork the [repo](https://github.com/javascript-pro/core) from GitHub
2. Run it locally with npm install && npm run dev
3. Explore the cartridges and start customizing

Goldlabel isn’t just a showcase — it’s a working platform you can build on. Whether you want to learn from it, launch a project quickly, or contribute improvements, everything is open.

When someone lands on a Goldlabel url, the site becomes aware of them; their device, their location and through their actions their intent.

They appear in the Pr0 console instantly as a ping. Within seconds, a display name and avatar are assigned, and a quiet notification appears on their screen.

| "This is not AI."

What just happened is a complete, real-time interaction. No installs, no login, no tracking scripts beyond the minimum. Just modern web tech doing what it was meant to do.

Goldlabel uses this demo to explain what's going on: the moment a prospect opens the link, we’re already connected. They see the quality of the sites clean design, fast load, relevant content while behind the scenes the system proves its capability in real time:

- Instant presence detection (the ping)
- Live two-way messaging
- Dynamic avatars and display names
- Real-time Firestore updates
- Sound cues and UI feedback

It’s a conversation disguised as a website — a handshake between technology and attention.
