#### Open Source Platform

It’s the public GitHub repository that powers goldlabel.pro — and it’s free for anyone to fork, copy, hack, and reuse.

#### What is it?

Goldlabel is a JavaScript platform built with:

- Next.js – modern React framework for the web
- React – component-driven architecture
- Material UI – clean, accessible, and customizable UI components

Everything you see on this production site is built from Goldlabel. It’s the full set of building blocks, ready to be adapted to your own projects.

#### Why Use Goldlabel?

- Open & Free – No lock-in. Take what you need, remix the rest.
- Production-Ready – The exact codebase that runs our live site.
- Cartridges – Modular units of functionality that can be dropped in or swapped out.
- Community-Friendly – Fork it, contribute back, or use it as inspiration.

#### Get Started

1. Clone or fork the [repo](https://github.com/javascript-pro/core) from GitHub
2. Run it locally with npm install && npm run dev
3. Explore the cartridges and start customizing

Goldlabel isn’t just a showcase — it’s a working platform you can build on. Whether you want to learn from it, launch a project quickly, or contribute improvements, everything is open.
