## Because all Apps need State Management

Otherwise you'd be back in jQuery callback hell. Nobody wants that. Uberedux is a simple, zero-config wrapper around Redux. It plugs cleanly into how the app already works and gives you the global state access you need without boilerplate or fuss. There’s nothing clever here — and that’s the point. Uberedux is fast, familiar, and already done for you.

If you've used Redux before, you already know how to use Uberedux. If you haven't, don't worry — the basics are dead simple. Actions update the store. Components subscribe to the parts they care about. That’s it.

We’ve trimmed the fat: no reducers to wire up manually, no sprawling folder trees, no indirection. Instead, you get a single useSlice() hook that gives you what you need, when you need it — whether that's in a form field, a route guard, or a floating modal.

Uberedux isn’t trying to win design awards. It's just here to work — cleanly, quietly, and consistently across your app. No surprises. No rewrites. Just state management that stays out of your way.
