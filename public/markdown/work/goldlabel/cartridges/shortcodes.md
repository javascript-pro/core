Goldlabel includes a Shortcodes cartridge that brings a familiar WordPress-style authoring pattern into a modern React/Next.js environment. Shortcodes let you drop small, purposeful commands directly into your markdown or content files — things like grids, cards, embeds, or custom UI elements — and have them render as fully interactive components on the page.

This gives editors a clean, readable way to compose rich layouts without touching JSX. Developers define the shortcodes; content authors use them; Goldlabel resolves them at render time. It’s a lightweight but powerful bridge between content and components, designed to keep your pages flexible, expressive, and easy to maintain.
