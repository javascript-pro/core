Chris Dorward – Senior JavaScript Developer  

I’m a seasoned developer with two decades of experience in web systems, now focused on React, TypeScript, and scalable app architecture. I’ve delivered work for startups corporates, and remote-first teams across the UK,

Europe, and Australia. I’m happiest building performant UIs and robust integrations, especially when there’s a clear brief and a team that values clean code and delivery. Outside of work, I write, travel, and dive — with one foot always in the sea and the other on the deploy button.
