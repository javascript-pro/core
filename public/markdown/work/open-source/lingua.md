The Lingua cartridge brings localisation to Goldlabel. It enables your site to serve content in multiple languages, making it accessible to a wider audience without complicating your codebase.

#### What is it?

- Language detection – automatically picks the right language based on browser or user preference
- Translation switching – seamless toggling between languages on the site
- Content structure – keeps translations organised and easy to maintain

#### Current Languages

Goldlabel starts with three languages out of the box:

- 🇬🇧 English
- 🇩🇪 Deutsch (German)
- 🇨🇳 简体中文 (Simplified Chinese)

Adding more languages is straightforward — simply extend the Lingua cartridge with additional translation files.

#### How It Works

- Translation strings are stored per cartridge, keeping everything modular
- Users can switch language at any time without reloading the app

#### Why Lingua?

- Modular: Ships as a cartridge — add it only if you need localisation
- Scalable: Start with one language, expand to many
- User-friendly: Automatic detection plus manual switching for full control
