`NewCartridge` is a template designed to help developers quickly bootstrap a new **Cartridge** in a modular application framework such as Goldlabel. Cartridges are feature-specific, plug-and-play components that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.

This template provides a standardized structure, boilerplate code, and default configuration to reduce setup time and ensure consistency across cartridges.

## Key Files

### `config.json`

```json
{
  "title": "New Cartridge",
  "description": "Template for bootstrapping a new cartridge",
  "icon": "cartridge",
  "slug": "/work/open-source/new-cartridge",
  "theme": {
    "name": "lemon",
    "mode": "dark",
    "primary": "#e8c10b",
    "secondary": "#fae45c",
    "background": "#303030",
    "paper": "#303030",
    "text": "#fffceb",
    "border": "#303030"
  }
}
```

Defines the cartridge metadata, including title, description, UI theming, and route slug.

## Getting Started

To use this cartridge template:

1. Copy the `NewCartridge` directory into your `/cartridges` folder.
2. Rename the folder and files appropriately.
3. Update `config.json` and the `slug` to reflect the new cartridge.
4. Begin extending components, hooks, and actions as needed.

This structure ensures your cartridge is consistent with the larger application architecture and easily pluggable.

## Notes

- The template assumes a Redux-style state structure but can be adapted as needed.
- The theme supports dark mode with lemon-yellow primary colors.

Enjoy building your cartridge.
