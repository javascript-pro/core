### Design Systems

In the theme cartridge, you use it as the foundation for all shared UI:
– MUI’s ThemeProvider establishes colours, typography, spacing and breakpoints.
– Components like Card, Grid, Box, Button, Dialog, Typography form the structural building blocks of all shared layouts.
– Custom elements (StandardCard, ConfirmDialog, PageGrid, etc.) wrap these primitives to enforce Goldlabel’s design language while staying flexible across cartridges and apps.
