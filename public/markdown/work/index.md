**Software built in the open.**  
Every app we ship is real, running in production, and developed in public.

## Active Projects

## What Makes This Different?

- **We ship early and often.**  
  Each of these apps is live — not just a mockup or a case study.

- **We share the process.**  
  You can follow development on GitHub, view the commit history, and even clone the code.

- **We build for reuse.**  
  Every component, pattern, and API is designed to be portable and production-ready.

### React

> We Specialise in React front ends. They aren't an afterthought on a stale old data layer, they are the very meat and veg of the app

### WordPress

> WordPress was great but has a time and a place. The time is in the past and the place is in the bin. But getting WordPress right was such a pain. The cost was double intended spend etc? Well it probably works pretty well now and everyone is used to it, so let's not rock that boat, right? Find out why you might want to think again
