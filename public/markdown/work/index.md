Goldlabel Core is always Free & Open Source as a public repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/javascript-pro/core). The apps we ship are real, run in production and are developed in public. The Core is Open Source and Free forever — giving you statically generated sites with Firestore-powered updates and a real admin panel. Built with Next.js App Router and Material UI

#### Benefits of building with Goldlabel

- Ship early and often.  
  Each app is live from the outset — not just a mockup or prototyle

- Share the process.  
  Follow the development on GitHub, view the commit history, clone the code. Get involved with Issues

- Built for reuse.  
  Every component, pattern, and API is designed to be portable and production-ready

#### Work With Us

We take on a limited number of new projects each month. If you need something done we’d love to hear about it. Find out if we're a [good fit](/cv). We're always looking for collaborators, contributors, and good ideas.
