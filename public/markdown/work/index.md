Goldlabel Core is the public-facing foundation of the Goldlabel Apps ecosystem. Itâ€™s a fast, static-first Next.js site powered by real-time data from Firestore and managed through a built-in admin interface. 

The app is designed to grow alongside our products, with a content system we can update anytime and an authentication layer that keeps control in our hands.
