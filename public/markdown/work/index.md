#### Working with Goldlabel

- Ship early and often.  
  Each app is live from the outset — not just a mockup or prototyle

- Share the process.  
  Follow the development on GitHub, view the commit history, clone the code. Get involved with Issues

- Built for reuse.  
  Every component, pattern, and API is designed to be portable and production-ready
