> The apps we ship are real, run in production, and developed in public

Open Source and Free forever — Statically generated with Firestore-powered updates and a real admin panel. Built with Next.js App Router and Material UI

#### Benefits of building with Goldlabel

- **Ship early and often.**  
  Each of your apps is live — not just a mockup or a case study

- **Share the process.**  
  Follow development on GitHub, view the commit history, clone the code

- **Build for reuse.**  
  Every component, pattern, and API is designed to be portable and production-ready

### Build with us

We're always looking for collaborators, contributors, and good ideas.
