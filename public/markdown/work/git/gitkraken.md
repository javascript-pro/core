> Now with AI Commit and PR Messaging

GitKraken isn’t just another Git GUI. It’s become an essential tool in our daily workflow—one of those rare bits of software that’s genuinely a joy to use. Fast, cross-platform, and beautifully designed, it takes the friction out of managing repos, branches, and merges.

We’ve used GitKraken for years. It simplifies the parts of Git that usually trip people up—resolving conflicts, visualising history, managing remotes—and does it all with a clean interface that doesn’t get in your way.

Recently, GitKraken added a feature that uses generative AI to write commit messages and pull request descriptions. And honestly, it’s brilliant.

Having meaningful commit messages and PR summaries isn't just good practice. It saves time, especially when someone (often a manager or another dev trying to understand your code from a distance) comes snooping through your Git history.

Let’s be honest—Git logs aren’t always written for clarity. With AI helping shape the language, the result is more consistent, more readable, and occasionally even insightful. This doesn’t just make your work look more polished; it also helps when switching context, onboarding new developers, or retracing steps months later.

### Why It Matters

GitKraken isn’t trying to replace Git—it’s helping you use it better. And now, it’s helping you communicate better. That’s the part most people underestimate in software: how well your tools let your team understand what’s going on.

With GitKraken, you get clarity, speed, and now, a little help from AI to sound more professional in your commits and pull requests. We recommend it without hesitation.
