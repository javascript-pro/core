## Fullstack JavaScript Developer

Over 20 years of experience delivering scalable web applications across startups, enterprises, and remote-first teams in the UK, Europe, and Australia. Deep expertise in React, TypeScript, and currently specialising in Next.js

I use AI tools as a development accelerator—treating them not as shortcuts, but as force multipliers. With experience and intent, AI helps me ship cleaner, production-grade code 2–3× faster and with fewer bugs. I focus on value delivery, human-centred design, and maintainable architecture

Comfortable both leading projects or contributing in agile teams, I value a clear brief, clean codebase, and collaborative culture. Outside work, I write, travel, surf, dive, and ski
