> Goldlabel Core is a project designed to deliver **powerful, user-friendly web applications** that enhance productivity and streamline tasks. The project uses a **monorepo** architecture with multiple Next.js applications deployed to **Vercel**.

Goldlabel Core is the public facing foundation of the Goldlabel Apps ecosystem. It’s a fast, static-first Next.js site powered by real-time data from Firestore and managed through a built-in admin interface.

The app is designed to grow alongside our products, with a content system we can update anytime and an authentication layer that keeps control in our hands.

At this stage, the **www** public-facing site is the primary focus, with an emphasis on **perfect SEO** and **static site generation** (SSG). The goals for the **www** app include:

- **Fast load times** with statically generated pages at build time.
- **Tight control** over metadata like titles, descriptions, and Open Graph information.
- A **responsive layout** with easily navigable pages, prioritizing serious, no-nonsense content presentation without large animations or oversized images.

---

### **Design and Development Goals**

1. **SEO and Performance Optimization**:

   - Static generation for key pages (e.g., `/about`, `/services`, `/contact`).
   - Metadata API in Next.js for defining page-level SEO (title, description, Open Graph data).
   - Lighthouse audits to maintain high performance and accessibility scores.

2. **Layout and Styling**:

   - Components follow a structured approach with a server-rendered **RootLayout** that integrates MUI (Material UI) for consistent theming.
   - The site avoids `use client` directives in layout components to ensure full compatibility with SSG and server-side rendering (SSR).
   - Emotion (for CSS-in-JS) is integrated with critical CSS extraction during build time to prevent hydration issues.

3. **Theme**:

   - A customizable MUI theme defines the color palette, typography, and component styles.
   - MUI components like `Typography` and `Box` are used extensively in the layout and static components, such as the header and footer.

4. **Core Components**:
   - **StaticHeader** and **StaticFooter** provide consistent navigation and branding across pages.
   - The footer includes links built with the Next.js `Link` component, styled using MUI's system (`sx` prop).

### **Technical Setup**

- The **monorepo** is managed with a combination of Next.js, MUI, and Emotion.
- The app is server-rendered for static content, ensuring minimal client-side hydration.
- **Emotion's SSR** integration extracts critical styles during the static build to prevent styling mismatches between server and client.
- The project supports rapid customization and updates through a shared component library and scalable page templates.

---

### **Future Directions**

- Additional applications may be deployed under the Goldlabel Apps umbrella.
- Features like dynamic data integration (e.g., Firebase, CMS) can enhance page content while preserving SEO and performance.
- Expansion of static and dynamic content to further enrich the user experience.
