> Developed by Facebook for building cross-platform mobile applications

It allows developers to use JavaScript and React (a widely used front-end library) to create native apps for both iOS and Android. Instead of writing separate codebases for each platform, React Native lets you write a single codebase that can be compiled into native code for both.

#### Why?

- Cross-Platform Development: React Native enables developers to create apps for both iOS and Android simultaneously, saving time and effort compared to writing separate code for each platform.

- Native Performance: Unlike traditional hybrid frameworks that rely on WebViews, React Native compiles to native code, resulting in better performance close to fully native apps.

- Component-Based Architecture: React Native follows the same component-based architecture as React, making it easy to manage and reuse code, leading to more maintainable and scalable apps.

- Large Ecosystem: With the backing of a large developer community and numerous libraries, React Native offers a rich ecosystem for building apps with extensive features.

- Faster Development: React Native's hot-reloading feature allows developers to instantly see changes in the app, speeding up the development process.

- Cost Efficiency: By sharing most of the code between platforms, React Native can significantly reduce development and maintenance costs.
