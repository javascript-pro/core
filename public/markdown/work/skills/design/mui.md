> In the React ecosystem, no other design system sees the same breadth of adoption

Material UI, commonly known as MUI, has grown into the most widely used React component library and design system. Its popularity comes from a mix of practical engineering benefits: a complete suite of pre-built components, a predictable theming model, strong TypeScript support, and an ecosystem that stays aligned with modern React patterns.

MUI solves the design system gap for teams that need polished UI out of the box without building every component from scratch. Layouts, form controls, grids, navigation, typography; everything behaves consistently, scales cleanly, and can be themed to match any brand. In the React ecosystem, no other design system sees the same breadth of adoption across startups, enterprise teams, and solo developers.

Goldlabel uses MUI as the foundation for its own theme cartridge, extending the base components with custom styling, utility components, and layout primitives. It gives a consistent look, predictable behaviour, and a reliable way to handle UI complexity without reinventing the basics.
