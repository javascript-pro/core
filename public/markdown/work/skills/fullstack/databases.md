> Choosing the right database still matters on every new project

## NoSQL for speed and agility

Two decades ago, most of our work sat on classic relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL. They powered early CMS sites and small apps where structured tables and SQL made perfect sense. As our projects grew more distributed—and the web shifted toward realtime experiences—we moved into the NoSQL world: MongoDB for flexible documents, then Firebase/Firestore for realtime sync and frictionless client access. On the cloud side, DynamoDB became the high-scale option for serverless architectures.

Each of these databases has shaped how we build software: SQL for strong structure and reporting, NoSQL for speed and agility, Firestore for instant multi-device updates, and DynamoDB for massive scale. This page outlines how we’ve used them over the years, and why choosing the right one still matters on every new project.
