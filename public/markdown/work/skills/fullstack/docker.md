## Why use Docker

Docker is process heavy. It can feel like you’re running a small datacentre on your laptop. But once a competent DevOps engineer lays out good images and clean Compose files, the payoff is real: fully reproducible environments, consistent tooling across the entire team, and the ability to run complex stacks locally without juggling virtual machines or bespoke system setups.

For modern projects with many moving parts, Docker isn’t always enjoyable, but it is practical. A necessary evil. At least for now.

## Kubernetes

Kubernetes sits above Docker-level containerisation and orchestrates fleets of containers across many machines. It handles scheduling, scaling, self-healing, rolling deploys, secrets, networking, and failover. In other words, Kubernetes is what you reach for when your system grows beyond a single box and you need reliability and automation at scale.

It’s powerful, complex, and often overkill for small projects. But for distributed systems with uptime requirements and elastic loads, Kubernetes is the standard.
