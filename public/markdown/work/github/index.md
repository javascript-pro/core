#### Other Source Control solutions are available

But they all use git. Git was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the same person who built the Linux kernel. Before Git, the Linux project used a proprietary system called BitKeeper, which revoked its free license after a dispute. Torvalds, needing a fast, distributed alternative, designed Git with a few key principles:

- Speed — handle large codebases like Linux efficiently
- Distributed architecture — every clone is a full repository
- Integrity — cryptographic tracking via SHA-1 hashes
- Simple branching/merging — enable experimentation

Soon after, the open-source community (notably Junio C Hamano) helped mature Git into the robust system it is today.

#### GitHub: Collaboration Layer (2008)

GitHub launched in April 2008, founded by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, PJ Hyett, and Scott Chacon. Their vision: make Git usable and social — a Facebook for code. Key innovations:

- Easy repository hosting and web-based UI for Git
- Pull requests, issues, wikis, and CI integrations
- Social features: stars, followers, and activity feeds

GitHub rapidly became the go-to platform for open-source projects, startups, and enterprises alike.
