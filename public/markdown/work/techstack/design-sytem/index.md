#### What is a Design System?

A Design System is a collection of reusable components, standards, and guidelines that define how a product looks and behaves. It includes UI elements like buttons, forms, and typography, along with rules for layout, spacing, and interaction patterns. The goal is consistency—both in user experience and in how teams design and build interfaces.

#### Why Use a Design System?

Using a design system ensures that everyone—from designers to developers—speaks the same visual language. It speeds up development, reduces duplication, and keeps interfaces accessible and cohesive across platforms. It also scales well. As teams grow, a design system helps maintain quality and coherence without slowing down progress.

#### Why Material Design?

We chose Material Design because it’s a battle-tested system backed by Google, with strong support across platforms. It comes with thoughtful defaults, clear accessibility standards, and a broad set of ready-to-use components. More importantly, it's flexible. Material adapts well to different brand identities, making it a solid foundation for custom styling while keeping UX best practices baked in.
