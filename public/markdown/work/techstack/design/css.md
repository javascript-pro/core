> CSS has been part of front-end development since the beginning

It shaped every era of layout, typography, and design on the web. The ecosystem around it expanded through countless methodologies and frameworks—each one attempting to simplify styling as the web grew more complex. Every phase left its mark, from early hand-written stylesheets to today’s utility-first engines like Tailwind.

Below is a clear timeline of the major CSS milestones and the tools that defined each generation:

## 1994 — CSS proposed

Håkon Wium Lie proposes Cascading Style Sheets as a way to separate content from presentation.

## 1996 — CSS1 released

Basic properties for fonts, colours, and simple layout. The earliest moment styling became standardised.

## 1998 — CSS2

Positioning, z-index, media types, and more complex selectors. The foundation for modern layout thinking.

## 2000–2004 — The table-layout era

Widespread browser inconsistencies push developers to rely on HTML tables for structure. CSS remains secondary.

## 2005–2007 — CSS starts winning

Float-based layouts, clearfix hacks, and the rise of clean semantic HTML push CSS to the centre of front-end work.

## 2006 — Sass

The first major CSS preprocessor introduces variables, mixins, and nested rules.

## 2007 — LESS

A lighter preprocessor that popularises dynamic CSS in mainstream workflows.

## 2010 — Bootstrap

Twitter releases Bootstrap, bringing grid systems, components, and consistent styling to the masses. Rapidly becomes the de facto UI framework of the early 2010s.

## 2011 — Foundation

ZURB’s Foundation offers a more flexible competitor to Bootstrap, widely used in responsive enterprise-style sites.

## 2013 — CSS Flexbox

A modern, intuitive layout model begins to transform frontend structure. Adoption starts slow due to browser support.

## 2014 — BEM, OOCSS, and SMACSS go mainstream

CSS methodologies spread across the industry, formalising naming conventions and component-based thinking.

## 2015 — CSS Modules

Bundlers begin allowing styles scoped to components. A major shift toward modular, React-aligned styling.

## 2016 — CSS Grid

A powerful, two-dimensional layout system lands. True modern layout begins here.

## 2017 — Tailwind CSS (utility-first)

A complete rethinking of styling. Utility classes replace custom CSS, enabling rapid UI building with predictable output. Quickly becomes one of the most adopted frameworks in modern frontend development.

## 2019 — Styled Components & Emotion mature

CSS-in-JS becomes deeply integrated with React. Styles become dynamic, themeable, and colocated with components.

## 2020s — Hybrid era

Developers mix approaches: Tailwind for layout and spacing, CSS-in-JS for logic-driven components, and raw CSS for global primitives. Tooling like PostCSS, autoprefixer, and modern build systems make everything interoperable.
