> Adobe. The evolution of digital creation?

Before the web existed as a commercial medium, Adobe Photoshop was already shaping digital design. It became the gateway for an entire generation of early web builders, long before CSS, browsers, or HTML standards matured. Over time, Adobe’s suite expanded into a full creative ecosystem that influenced every stage of web and product design.

Below is a focused timeline of Adobe’s major products as they emerged:

## 1987 — Photoshop (initial development)

Thomas and John Knoll begin developing a program called Display, which evolves into Photoshop.

## 1990 — Adobe Photoshop 1.0

The first commercial release. Digital image manipulation becomes mainstream. This tool dominated the era of slicing static layouts into HTML.

## 1993 — Adobe Acrobat & PDF

A universal document format is born. Crucial for print, later for digital workflow and assets.

## 1993 — Adobe Premiere

Early video editing enters Adobe’s world, laying the foundation for the future Creative Cloud video suite.

## 1994 — Adobe After Effects

Compositing and motion graphics arrive, essential for animation workflows and later UI motion design references.

## 1999 — Adobe InDesign

The successor to PageMaker. Modern digital publishing begins. Influences layout thinking that eventually moves into web grids.

## 2003 — Adobe Illustrator (major modernisation)

Illustrator predates this year, but the CS era redefines it as a core vector tool. Modern SVG-focused workflows trace their lineage back to this point.

## 2005 — Adobe acquires Macromedia

A watershed moment. Flash, Fireworks, and Dreamweaver all become part of Adobe.
Fireworks, especially, plays a major role in early web/UI design before being discontinued.

## 2007 — Adobe Lightroom

Photography workflow and raw processing become centralised, reinforcing Adobe’s dominance in visual asset production.

## 2011 — Adobe Edge tools

An attempt to replace Flash with HTML/CSS/JS animation tooling. Short-lived but influential.

## 2017 — Adobe XD

Adobe’s response to Sketch and later Figma. Vector-driven, prototyping-first, and focused on modern product design workflows.
