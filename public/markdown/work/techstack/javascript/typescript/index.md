> JavaScript was never meant for what became asked of it. It started life scripting image rollovers in the ‘90s — and somehow ended up running banks and billion-dollar web apps.

By the early 2010s, the cracks were showing. Huge front-ends written in Vanilla JavaScript were turning into fragile spaghetti — a single mistyped property could break production. There was no safety net. No way to refactor confidently. No way to know what an object really looked like until runtime.

Created at Microsoft by Anders Hejlsberg (the same mind behind C#), TypeScript was released in 2012 as a bold idea: add a type system to JavaScript, but keep it completely compatible.

It didn’t replace JS — it wrapped it with a layer of safety, structure, and intelligence. Suddenly, your editor could understand your code. You could autocomplete reliably, catch errors before running, and refactor without fear.

At first, the community was skeptical. Another Microsoft language? No thanks.
But when Angular 2 adopted TypeScript in 2016, everything changed. Soon React, Vue, Node, and Next.js developers were all using it — not because they had to, but because they didn’t want to go back.

Today, TypeScript is how professional JavaScript gets written. It’s the balance between flexibility and reliability — the best of both worlds. JavaScript still runs the web. TypeScript just makes sure it doesn’t crash.

#### ⚙️ Tech Summary

**Created by:** Anders Hejlsberg, Microsoft  
**First released:** 2012

**Purpose:**  
Add optional static typing and modern tooling to large-scale JavaScript projects.

**First major adopter:**  
Angular 2 (2016)

**Problem solved:**  
Fragile, untyped codebases that broke silently at runtime.

**Today:**  
Widely adopted across React, Vue, Node, and Next.js — the de facto language of modern JavaScript development.

## Why TypeScript?

There was a time when using TypeScript felt optional — an extra layer for developers who liked type systems or came from Java or C#, but that time is over.

Today, the question isn’t "why use TypeScript?" — it’s "why would you develop without it?"

TypeScript catches the kinds of mistakes that JavaScript only tells you about at runtime. It prevents you from calling functions that don’t exist, passing wrong arguments, or forgetting to handle undefined. It turns invisible bugs into visible red lines in your editor — before you hit save.

> That’s the difference between guessing and knowing.

Modern frameworks like Next.js, React, and Angular are built with TypeScript in mind.
The ecosystem — from libraries to IDEs — assumes it. You get stronger autocompletion, safer refactors, better API docs, and fewer production errors, all by writing the same code you were already writing — just with types.

For greenfield projects, starting without TypeScript makes no sense anymore. You’d be giving up type safety, editor intelligence, and long-term maintainability for no real gain. And since TypeScript compiles to JavaScript, there’s zero runtime penalty — just fewer bugs and better confidence.

TypeScript isn’t a choice. It’s now how all serious JavaScript gets written.
