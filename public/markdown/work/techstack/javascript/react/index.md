React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, originally developed by Jordan Walke at Facebook and open-sourced in 2013. It introduced a fundamentally new way of thinking about front-end development: treating the UI as a pure function of state, rendered through a virtual DOM that efficiently updates the real DOM when data changes. At its core, React popularised three key ideas:

- Declarative UI — describing what the UI should look like, not how to manually manipulate the DOM.
- Component architecture — breaking interfaces into reusable, composable building blocks.
- Unidirectional data flow — making apps easier to reason about and debug.
