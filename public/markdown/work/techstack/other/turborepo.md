> Fast, predictable build system with smart caching and pipeline orchestration

## Monorepos used to be painful

Slow installs, duplicated dependencies, and build steps that scaled badly as a codebase grew. Turborepo changed that for us. It gave our multi-package projects a fast, predictable build system with smart caching and pipeline orchestration. After years of juggling separate repos, Turborepo let us treat our ecosystem as one coherent workspace—speeding up development and making shared code straightforward.
