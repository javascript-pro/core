Even small projects with just one or two people benefit from an agile approach. The early ideas scribbled on the back of an envelope or sketched out on a kitchen table are often the most creative â€” but they only lead somewhere if thereâ€™s a clear process wrapped around them. Agile provides that structure: short cycles, visible progress, and regular reflection. It ensures that even the most informal beginnings are backed by a rigorous framework that keeps momentum, reduces risk, and gives every idea a fair chance to grow into something real.
