## WordPress Modernisation

> Keep your WordPress database, admin, and SEO intact — and layer a modern React + TypeScript app on top. Goldlabel upgrades WordPress without replacing it.

Building with WordPress taught us a lot. Not just about PHP or plugins, but about _how people want to build_. We learned that

- Teams want **control** without becoming sysadmins.
- Designers want **freedom** without breaking everything.
- Clients want **speed** — and they don’t care what stack it’s built on.
- Developers want **modern tools**, not legacy workarounds.
