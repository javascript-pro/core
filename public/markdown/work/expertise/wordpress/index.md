## WordPress powers 50% of all websites

> We treat an existing WordPress installation as a data source, not a problem to fix.

[PrevNext prev="/work/expertise/wordpress/case-study" next="/work/expertise/wordpress/modernising"]

- Your **database** stays where it is — MySQL, posts, pages, taxonomies — untouched.
- Your **wp-admin** stays the same — clients keep using the editor they already know.
- Your **SEO** stays safe — same URLs, same permalinks, same meta tags.
- Your **content** becomes available via the REST API (or GraphQL if you prefer).

Goldlabel simply **plugs in** to that source, fetches content, and renders it in a modern JavaScript app — powered by React, Next.js, and Firestore.

- No downtime
- No retraining your editors
- No broken backlinks
- No new CMS fear
