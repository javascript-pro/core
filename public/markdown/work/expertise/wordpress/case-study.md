> How a Shenzhen-based studio used Goldlabel to bring performance, scalability, and modern UX to its WordPress portfolio — without rebuilding from scratch

### Case Study: Rahul Sharma Studios

**Client:** Rahul Sharma, Shenzhen, China  
**Sector:** Web design & development studio  
**Portfolio:** ~20 active WordPress sites for diverse clients  
**Period:** 2025–2026

#### Background

Rahul Sharma’s studio had spent years crafting and maintaining around twenty WordPress sites for clients across industries — retail, architecture, education, and lifestyle brands. The sites worked, but keeping them fast, secure, and modern was becoming increasingly difficult. Each new feature required yet another plugin or fragile PHP tweak.

Rahul wasn’t looking to abandon WordPress; he simply wanted a way to **upgrade** his clients’ existing sites without reinventing the wheel.

#### The Challenge

- Aging WordPress themes and plugin dependencies
- SEO and content tightly coupled to legacy templates
- Clients expecting faster, more app-like performance
- Limited ability to integrate modern front-end tooling (React, TypeScript, APIs)

Rahul needed a forward path that wouldn’t disrupt content workflows or require rebuilding two decades of investment.

#### The Goldlabel Solution

I introduced **Goldlabel** to Rahul in early 2025.  
The idea of treating WordPress as a _data source_ rather than something to replace immediately clicked.

Goldlabel’s **server-side rendering (SSR)** via Next.js offered the high performance and SEO control his clients demanded, while preserving their existing databases and admin workflows.

Together, we built a modernization workflow:

1. **Keep WordPress** as the CMS of record.
2. **Expose content** through the WordPress REST API.
3. **Render with Goldlabel** — React, TypeScript, Firestore, and CDN-cached SSR.
4. **Deploy progressively** — site by site, section by section.

#### Results (First 3 Months)

- **6 websites modernized** between February and May 2025
- Average **page-load time reduced by 65 %**
- Improved **Core Web Vitals scores** across all migrated sites
- Zero downtime or SEO disruption
- Seamless editor experience — clients kept using `wp-admin`

#### Roadmap

Encouraged by the early success, Rahul’s team has a **roadmap of 30 more sites** to modernize by **Q1 2026**.  
Each follows the same principle:

> _Don’t rebuild. Extend._

By layering Goldlabel’s modern JavaScript architecture on top of WordPress, Rahul’s studio has unlocked a future-proof stack — one that serves existing clients better and positions the studio as a leader in modern web performance.

#### Quote

> “Our clients didn’t want a new CMS — they wanted faster, smoother sites.  
> Goldlabel gave us a way to deliver that without starting over.”  
> — **Rahul Sharma**, Founder, Shenzhen

#### Key Takeaway

Goldlabel provides agencies like Rahul’s with a **practical, low-risk path** to bring modern web capabilities to long-standing WordPress portfolios — proving that modernization doesn’t have to mean migration.
