> Keep it simple. Start small. Scale when you need to.

## Hardware for Abgeschottet KI

One of the advantages of Abgeschottet KI is that it’s a low‑investment, quick‑to‑implement solution.  
You don’t need a full data centre to get started, and you can scale up later as usage grows.

### Start with something simple and reliable

If you have around 100 staff with no more than 10 people using the LLM at the same time, a single entry‑level rack server is more than enough.

A good example is the Dell PowerEdge R240 or its successor in the same range.  
It’s:

- Affordable and easy to source,
- Well supported with spare parts and warranties,
- Compact (1U rackmount) and energy‑efficient,
- Powerful enough for a modest internal AI workload.

### Why not something bigger?

You don’t need to over‑engineer this.  
The software is lightweight and can run comfortably on a single box. When demand grows, you can simply add another server or upgrade to a more powerful blade without redesigning the setup.

In short:  
Start with a solid, entry‑level server from a reputable brand like Dell. It keeps costs down, deployment fast, and future scaling simple.
