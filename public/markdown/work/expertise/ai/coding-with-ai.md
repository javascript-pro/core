## AI changes everything in Software Development

> It raises the bar. What took 6 months, a team of 10 developers and full time project management can now be done by a single developer in two months. It raises the bar.

_Here comes the science bit..._

This is possible because AI dramatically accelerates many parts of the development cycle. It automates repetitive coding, generates boilerplate, and quickly produces prototypes that would otherwise take weeks.

Documentation, testing, and debugging are streamlined by tools that can spot errors or suggest fixes instantly. Even design and architecture benefit from AI’s ability to analyze patterns and propose solutions.

The biggest time savings come from:

- Faster coding – AI can write functions, components, and tests in seconds.
- Reduced overhead – less time spent on coordination, hand-offs, and project management.
- Accelerated learning – developers don’t need to research for hours; they can ask the AI and get tailored guidance immediately.
- Iterative speed – prototypes and revisions happen much faster, compressing months of iteration into weeks.

In short, AI reduces friction across the lifecycle, letting a single developer achieve the output of an entire team.
