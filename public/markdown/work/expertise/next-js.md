> Next.js is a full-stack JavaScript framework that brings together the power of React on the frontend with seamless backend capabilities, creating a unified developer experience. It simplifies the process of building modern web applications by offering a complete toolkit out of the box.

#### Why We Use It

Traditional frontend frameworks like React are powerful, but they leave a lot of heavy lifting to the developer when it comes to routing, server-side rendering, static site generation, and deployment. This is where Next.js shines:

- Hybrid Rendering: Choose between static generation, server-side rendering, or client-side rendering on a per-page basis.
- Built-in Routing: File-based routing makes navigation and structure intuitive.
- API Routes: Define backend functions in the same codebase using the `/api` folder, removing the need for a separate backend server.
- TypeScript Support: Native support for TypeScript enhances safety and developer experience.
- Image Optimization: Next.js handles modern formats, resizing, and lazy loading automatically.
- Internationalization: Built-in i18n support for multi-language sites.
- Fast Refresh: Instant feedback on edits for a smoother development cycle.

#### Solving Real-World Problems

Every real-world project ends up needing some combination of:

- Route management
- API endpoints
- SEO configuration
- Image handling
- Page loading strategies
- Secure deployment

Instead of cobbling together 10 different libraries and configurations, Next.js gives you a coherent way to manage all of these within a single, maintainable framework. It saves enormous time on boilerplate setup and bug hunting.
