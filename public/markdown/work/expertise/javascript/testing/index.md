## Left looking

A left-looking approach in JavaScript testing means testing earlier in the development process — before code reaches production. Using tools like Jest for unit and integration tests and Playwright for end-to-end browser testing, issues are caught as code is written rather than after release. This reduces rework, improves reliability, and keeps delivery cycles fast and confident. It’s about building quality in from the start, not inspecting it in at the end.
