## JavaScript with Seatbelts

JavaScript was never meant for this. It started life scripting image rollovers in the ‘90s — and somehow ended up running banks and billion-dollar web apps.

By the early 2010s, the cracks were showing. Huge front-ends written in Vanilla JavaScript were turning into fragile spaghetti — a single mistyped property could break production. There was no safety net. No way to refactor confidently. No way to know what an object really looked like until runtime.

## Enter TypeScript

Created at Microsoft by Anders Hejlsberg (the same mind behind C#), TypeScript was released in 2012 as a bold idea: add a type system to JavaScript, but keep it completely compatible.

It didn’t replace JS — it wrapped it with a layer of safety, structure, and intelligence. Suddenly, your editor could understand your code. You could autocomplete reliably, catch errors before running, and refactor without fear.

At first, the community was skeptical. Another Microsoft language? No thanks.
But when Angular 2 adopted TypeScript in 2016, everything changed. Soon React, Vue, Node, and Next.js developers were all using it — not because they had to, but because they didn’t want to go back.

Today, TypeScript is how professional JavaScript gets written. It’s the balance between flexibility and reliability — the best of both worlds. JavaScript still runs the web. TypeScript just makes sure it doesn’t crash.

#### ⚙️ Tech Summary

**Created by:** Anders Hejlsberg, Microsoft  
**First released:** 2012

**Purpose:**  
Add optional static typing and modern tooling to large-scale JavaScript projects.

**First major adopter:**  
Angular 2 (2016)

**Problem solved:**  
Fragile, untyped codebases that broke silently at runtime.

**Today:**  
Widely adopted across React, Vue, Node, and Next.js — the de facto language of modern JavaScript development.
