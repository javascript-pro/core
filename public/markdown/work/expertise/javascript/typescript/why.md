## Why TypeScript?

There was a time when using TypeScript felt optional — an extra layer for developers who liked type systems or came from Java or C#, but that time is over.

Today, the question isn’t "why use TypeScript?" — it’s "why would you develop without it?"

TypeScript catches the kinds of mistakes that JavaScript only tells you about at runtime. It prevents you from calling functions that don’t exist, passing wrong arguments, or forgetting to handle undefined. It turns invisible bugs into visible red lines in your editor — before you hit save.

> That’s the difference between guessing and knowing.

Modern frameworks like Next.js, React, and Angular are built with TypeScript in mind.
The ecosystem — from libraries to IDEs — assumes it. You get stronger autocompletion, safer refactors, better API docs, and fewer production errors, all by writing the same code you were already writing — just with types.

For greenfield projects, starting without TypeScript makes no sense anymore. You’d be giving up type safety, editor intelligence, and long-term maintainability for no real gain. And since TypeScript compiles to JavaScript, there’s zero runtime penalty — just fewer bugs and better confidence.

TypeScript isn’t a choice. It’s now how all serious JavaScript gets written.
