## And then there was Node

Back in the mid-2000s, most of the web ran on PHP — powering WordPress, Drupal, Joomla — and developers often had to juggle PHP on the backend and JavaScript on the frontend. Data formats varied — XML, serialized PHP, or proprietary APIs. Integration between systems was clunky.

In 2009, Ryan Dahl released Node.js, introducing JavaScript on the server. Suddenly, developers could use a single language across the full stack — a big productivity shift.

By around 2012–2013, npm and frameworks like Express.js matured, making Node a realistic choice for production. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), standardised by Douglas Crockford in the early 2000s and adopted widely by APIs by 2010, became the lingua franca of web data. REST APIs and later GraphQL solidified JSON as the universal format connecting frontend and backend.

That combination — Node + JSON + ubiquitous JavaScript — was transformative:

- JavaScript devs could write backend logic without switching paradigms.
- Data flowed naturally between client and server.
- Tooling (npm, webpack, TypeScript) evolved into today’s unified ecosystem.

So for people coming from the WordPress/Drupal world, Node.js wasn’t just another backend — it represented a unification of the web stack, enabling real-time apps, server-side rendering, and microservices, all in JavaScript.
