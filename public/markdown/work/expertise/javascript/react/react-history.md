When React appeared, the landscape was dominated by AngularJS, Backbone, and Knockout, all of which relied on two-way data binding and manual DOM updates. React’s performance and simplicity stood out immediately, even though at the time its JSX syntax and functional mindset were controversial.

By 2015–2016, React had evolved beyond an experiment — Facebook, Instagram, and Airbnb were using it at scale, and the open-source ecosystem around it (Redux, React Router, Create React App) was maturing rapidly.

If we’re setting up the narrative for when and why we backed React at Hwahui, the context would be around that 2015–2016 window — a period when many teams were moving away from Angular 1.x or jQuery-driven UIs toward React’s component-based architecture. It was a forward-looking decision that aligned with the industry shift toward declarative, composable front-end systems.
