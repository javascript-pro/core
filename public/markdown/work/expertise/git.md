## We use GitHub for everything.

Including project management. Most of the communication done between us and our clients during development is done through GitHub in the form of comments, pull resuests, reviews and so forth

#### GitKraken - The best thing since sliced bread and chocolate spread

> Now with AI Commit and PR Messaging

GitKraken isn’t just another Git GUI. It’s become an essential tool in our daily workflow—one of those rare bits of software that’s genuinely a joy to use. Fast, cross-platform, and beautifully designed, it takes the friction out of managing repos, branches, and merges.

We’ve used GitKraken for years. It simplifies the parts of Git that usually trip people up—resolving conflicts, visualising history, managing remotes—and does it all with a clean interface that doesn’t get in your way.

### Why It Matters

GitKraken isn’t trying to replace Git—it’s helping you use it better. And now, it’s helping you communicate better. That’s the part most people underestimate in software: how well your tools let your team understand what’s going on.

With GitKraken, you get clarity, speed, and now, a little help from AI to sound more professional in your commits and pull requests. We recommend it without hesitation.
