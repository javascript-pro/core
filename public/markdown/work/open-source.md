## Why We Open Source

We’ve been building JavaScript applications for over 20 years. In that time, we’ve seen tools come and go. Trends rise, crash, and return again under a different name.

What’s remained consistent is this: the best software comes from open collaboration.

### Open Source Makes Us Sharper

Every time we publish a piece of code publicly, we’re saying _this is good enough to stand on its own_.

That raises the bar for how we work. Our interfaces get clearer. Our naming gets tighter. Our patterns get simpler. Writing code that others can understand forces us to think in terms that last.

And when someone opens an issue or submits a pull request, we learn. That’s a gift.

### Open Source Makes Us Faster

We reuse what we build.

By open-sourcing common utilities, design components, and workflows, we cut down the overhead of spinning up new projects. Whether we’re building an internal tool or a client-facing app, we pull from the same shared libraries—kept clean and documented because they’re public.

Our stack gets stronger with every project.

### Open Source Builds Trust

When a client or collaborator can see exactly how a feature is built, it changes the conversation.

We’re not hiding behind buzzwords. We’re showing our work. That transparency builds confidence—and often sparks better ideas from the people we’re working with.

We believe in solving problems out in the open, not behind closed doors.

### Open Source Powers the Future

Most of the tools we rely on—React, Next.js, Firebase, MUI—exist because someone decided to open source their work.

We give back because we’re part of that ecosystem. It’s how the web moves forward.

When we publish something as Open Source, it’s an invitation: _take this, improve it, make it yours_.

### What We Open Source

- _Core UI libraries_ used across our products
- _Markdown-based content loaders_ and site generators
- _PWA boilerplates_ and frontend architecture patterns
- _Weekend Portfolio apps_—real, working projects anyone can use or remix
- ...and more, as we go

We build in the open because it makes our work better.

If something you see sparks an idea, run with it. That’s the point.
