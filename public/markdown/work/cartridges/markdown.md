> In short: Markdown keeps our content lightweight, portable, and friendly to both humans and machines

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a plain text format for writing content that’s meant to be both **human-readable** and **web-ready**. It was invented by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz with a simple idea: writing for the web shouldn’t feel like writing code.

With Markdown, a heading looks like this:

```
# Heading One
```

A link looks like this:

```
[Goldlabel](https://goldlabel.pro)
```

And that’s the whole point — Markdown is **as readable in its raw form** as it is when rendered on screen.

## Why We Use Markdown Everywhere

At Goldlabel, we use Markdown for everything from site pages to internal documentation. Here’s why:

- **Readable by default** — No weird syntax or clunky editors. Anyone can open a `.md` file and understand what it’s saying.
- **Perfect for version control** — Markdown works seamlessly with Git. No binary conflicts, no surprises.
- **Flexible** — Whether it’s content for a blog, a legal page, or an app tutorial, Markdown adapts.
- **Composable** — We treat Markdown as a building block. You can load it from disk, pull it from Firestore, or drop it straight into a component.
- **Developer-first** — Our devs write Markdown like they write code. Same editor, same workflow, less friction.

That’s why we lean on it — and why we’re making tools like `MarkDownPreview`
