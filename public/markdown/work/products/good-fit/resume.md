## Fullstack JavaScript Developer

[Chris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-dorward/) is a seasoned developer with two decades of experience in web systems, now focused on React, TypeScript, and scalable app architecture. I’ve delivered work for startups corporates, and remote-first teams across the UK,

Europe, and Australia. I’m happiest building performant UIs and robust integrations, especially when there’s a clear brief and a team that values clean code and delivery. Outside of work, I write, travel, and dive — with one foot always in the sea and the other on the deploy button.

## Profile

Senior JavaScript Developer with over 20 years of experience and a deep focus on modern React architecture, systems design, and DevOps. Proven success delivering React/Redux applications with robust CI/CD pipelines, containerisation, and scalable architecture.

Strong track record in remote contract roles and hybrid teams using TypeScript, Redux-Saga, Docker, and GraphQL. Equally comfortable debugging code, mentoring engineers, or discussing systems strategy with stakeholders.
