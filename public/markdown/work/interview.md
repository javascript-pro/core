### React Developer

[aurosafe.com](https://aurosafe.com)

The client is a London-based tech company building smart compliance and monitoring software that connects IoT devices into one platform. You’ll be joining a small, on-site team developing B2B web apps used across property and compliance management.

They’re looking for a mid–senior React Developer who can take ownership of clean, scalable frontend code and work closely with backend and design teams. The stack includes React, a meta framework (like Next.js), Chakra UI, and GraphQL.

#### Key Points

Be ready to discuss how you’ve built and structured React apps in production.

Talk about your approach to state management, component reusability, and API integration (GraphQL is a big plus).

They’ll want to see you understand UI performance optimisation and accessibility best practices.

Highlight experience working in Agile teams, collaborating with backend engineers and designers.

Expect some technical discussion or whiteboard-style problem solving around hooks, data fetching, or component design.

He’ll be looking for three key traits:

- **Athlete’s Grit** – examples of when you pushed through challenges and delivered under pressure.

- **Captain’s Duty** – times you took ownership, showed integrity, and followed through without being asked.

- **Fun Loving Heart** – how you bring positive energy, support teammates, and help create an enjoyable, hard-working environment.
