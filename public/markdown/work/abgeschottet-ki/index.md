> A ring‑fenced LLM is like having the power of AI inside a locked room. It can process sensitive documents and assist with legal work, but nothing ever leaves the firm’s secure network.

When we say an AI or Large Language Model (LLM) is ring‑fenced, we mean it is completely contained within a secure environment — with no pathway for data to escape to the public internet.

Technically, this involves running the LLM on internal servers or approved cloud infrastructure. The model is hosted on hardware or a private cloud that the firm controls, rather than a public AI platform thus

- Blocking external connections
- Using local storage only
- Strict access controls
- No training on client data unless approved
