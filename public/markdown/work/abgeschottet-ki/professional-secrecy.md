## What Does _Professional Secrecy_ Mean for UK Lawyers?

When you speak to a lawyer in the UK, everything you tell them in confidence is protected by a strict legal duty called **professional secrecy**.

It means your lawyer **must not share your information with anyone else** – not the police, not the other side in your case, not even other clients – unless you give clear permission or the law absolutely requires it.

This protection exists so you can speak openly with your lawyer. The advice you get is only as good as the information you provide.
