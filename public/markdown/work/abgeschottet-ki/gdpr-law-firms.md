## What Does the GDPR Mean for a UK Law Firm?

The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** – as kept in UK law after Brexit – sets strict rules on how law firms handle any information that could identify a person.

- We must have a clear reason to use your data.
- We must keep it safe.
- We must only keep what we need, for as long as we need it.
- You have rights over your data.
- We are accountable.
