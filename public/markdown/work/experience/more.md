> It's only been a few years since all Boral's business was all done on paper

Boral was an interesting experience. I joined a very strong Agile team run by Xavier. He had hired a bunch of contractors to form a kind of protoyping unit. There were solid backend engineers, frontend specialists and everyone you could think of in between and they were doing some fine work

The problem - a normal one for a largish company - was that it's only been a few years since all their business was all done on paper. In that time all kinds of approaches and MicroServices have been built, expired and been badly version managed.

If we wanted to make some sensible use of the data, we could and did use GraphQL to collate it from various endpoints and present it to the frontend in the beautiful, elegant way that Graph QL does.

The data we wanted to use was real time Geo information being fed to the cloud from the smartphones of every one of the fleet of 200+ vehicles across Australia

Grab that data in real time, augment it with relevant data and plot them all on a map as dots. Voila, Dots on a Map - a prototype Geo Spatial app ready for the Boral Governace board to make quick iterative decisions as to what the team should next persuse

- **Captain’s Duty** – times I took ownership, showed integrity, and followed through without being asked 

The experience had it's challenges. The difficulty our talented young Chinese frontend developer had communicating with her backend counterpart were helped by my suggesting that they focus on the Graph QL common language between them.

This allowed me to focus on the State Management layer so that once all the pieces were built, they all fitted together to create a working app



- **Athlete’s Grit** – examples of when I pushed through challenges and delivered under pressure?

Obviously in such an environment priorities can change daily and keeping flexible to those changes is a full time job


Other stuff we did
- Built foundational test architecture using Cucumber, Gherkin and BDD principles
- Developed and tested multiple React PWAs with AWS Amplify and GraphQL
- Enabled CI/CD workflows to support rapid feature deployment
