> Each page focuses on a single part of the system

## Clone the public repository

This section walks through a minimal Goldlabel Core project from start to finish. Each page focuses on a single part of the system so you can see how the framework works in practice: how content is structured, how cartridges plug in, and how the app turns Markdown into a complete site.

You’ll clone the public repository, run the project locally, explore the folder layout, and understand how pages, components, and the global configuration interact. By the end, you’ll have a working mental model of Core and how to extend it with your own cartridges or custom UI.

Use the pages in order, or jump directly to the area you need.
