# Overview

## Purpose

`NewCartridge` is a template designed to help developers quickly bootstrap a new **Cartridge** in a modular application framework such as Goldlabel. Cartridges are feature-specific, plug-and-play components that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.

This template provides a standardized structure, boilerplate code, and default configuration to reduce setup time and ensure consistency across cartridges.

Brief instructions and intended use of the template.

## Getting Started

To use this cartridge template:

1. Copy the `NewCartridge` directory into your `/cartridges` folder.
2. Rename the folder and files appropriately.
3. Update `config.json` and the `slug` to reflect the new cartridge.
4. Begin extending components, hooks, and actions as needed.

This structure ensures your cartridge is consistent with the larger application architecture and easily pluggable.

## Notes

- The template assumes a Redux-style state structure but can be adapted as needed.
- The theme supports dark mode with lemon-yellow primary colors.

Enjoy building your cartridge.
