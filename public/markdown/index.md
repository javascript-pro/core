> **Custom software that works.** We build and ship modern web apps for clients who need real results — fast

## Next Gen, Gen X, Next.js, AI Prompt Engineering, OpenAI & Singularity

Goldlabel Apps is a UK-based software company that designs, builds, and maintains full-stack web applications. We specialize in **Next.js**, **Firebase**, and **custom UI development**, delivering everything from internal admin tools to polished public-facing websites.

Whether you're a startup with a short deadline or an enterprise with complex workflows, we can help.

### How We Work

- **Small teams. Big output.**  
  Our projects are lean by design. We focus on fast delivery without the overhead.

- **Real deployments from Day One.**  
  We don’t wait to launch. Every app we build runs live in production — from the first commit to the final release.

- **Readable, extensible codebases.**  
  You’ll never be locked in. Our code is designed to be picked up by your team — or handed back to us when needed.

### Examples in the Wild

- **SpeakWrite**  
  A voice-to-campaign tool powered by AI, turning speech into complete social media kits.

- **Goldlabel Core**  
  Our own site — a showcase of real-time content updates, Firestore-powered admin tools, and public documentation.

- **Weekend Portfolio**  
  A series of standalone, production-ready app templates you can build in a weekend.

### Work With Us

We take on a limited number of new projects each quarter. If you need:

- A custom admin portal
- A branded AI tool
- A fast, SEO-optimized marketing site
- Or something completely new

We’d love to hear about it.
