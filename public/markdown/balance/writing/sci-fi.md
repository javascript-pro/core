#### That's soience mayte

Because we can carefully observe constellations when the Sun is not blocking their path, we know what position the stars should be in when the Sun is keeping us from seeing them. However, according to Einstein, the light from the stars would be slightly curved around the Sun and to us would appear in a different position. Once again, imagine flicking that marble at your friend.

If they caught it, but were unable to see where you were standing, they might think you're in a different position than where you actually are because they'll trace that marble directly back in a straight line to the other side of the trampoline. This light-bending phenomenon is now known as gravitational lensing, but in Einstein's day it was only a prediction, his prediction.
