> The death sport capital of the world

[YouTube src="https://youtu.be/FtcOeCLt838"]

Chamonix Mont Blanc, France. The death sport and freeskiing capital of the world. This is the closing day party on the Grande Montets, 4th May 2008.

There's parapenting, hot women and even some nutters jumping out of a heliwopper with squirrel suits on.

Best of all, it's in High Definition, which was new at the time. Until this point we were still using PAL
