> London, Summer 2004

[YouTube src="https://youtu.be/lSRtbgt5ays"]

Made in the summer of 2004 when living in Deptford, London. I drove a bashed up Gold Beemer and had a shaved head. It helped to look a bit hard to live there. In making this film I tried to capture a bit of how it felt to live in the place.

Music is from a demo CD called The Move by the mooschool. Nick and Mike Maroussas, old school friends. Find out more about their hiphop career and download more mooschool music
