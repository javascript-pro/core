Let's share some of Einstein's contributions which are fundamental to understanding many concepts we'll encounter in this series.

I mentioned in the last lecture this idea of Gedanken experiments, thought experiments, and they really played into a lot of the discoveries that Albert Einstein made. He was able to conceptualize problems and then apply math and physics equations that would break through and result in us understanding more of our world. Many of the solutions from the Gedanken experiments are now fundamental laws of physics.

Albert Einstein famously worked at a patent office and developed these thought experiments that resulted in massive changes to our understanding of our universe. He evaluated a lot of patents that had to do with electricity and mechanics, which show up in many of his Gedanken experiments. He also benefited from regular interactions with multiple philosophers and scientists, including our good friend Henri Poincaré from the last lecture. Anyway, in 1905, Einstein's genius burst into the scene in spectacular fashion. Historians refer to 1905 as Einstein's miracle year.

He not only finished his Ph.D. dissertation, but published four papers that fundamentally changed all of physics. This included papers on special relativity, Brownian motion, which is the random motion of particles at a tiny scale, mass-energy equivalence, and wave-particle duality. Let's look at those last two in more detail. The first Gedanken experiment that really pushed the limits of fundamental Newtonian physics is called the equivalence principle.

Einstein realized that if a person was in free fall, accelerating at 9.8 meters per second squared, they would not feel the pull of gravity. Effectively, the free fall would cancel out the force of gravity. From realizing this, Einstein thought that if a person was in a box accelerating through space—yes, I mean zero-gravity space—at 9.8 meters per second squared, they would not feel any different than just standing on the surface of the Earth. To expand this, the equivalence principle states that at any point in spacetime, the effects of a gravitational field cannot be distinguished from a box that's accelerating through space.

The science fiction show The Expanse represents this brilliantly as the ships in the series use constant acceleration of 9.8 meters per second squared to provide gravity on their ships. We'll dive into this and much more when we talk about how to generate artificial gravity in lecture 4. Not to be confused with the equivalence principle is mass-energy equivalence, which is one of Einstein's most famous so-called discoveries. You probably know the mass-energy equivalence equation, E equals mc squared, but you may not have thought much about the implications of that little equation. What it says is that all mass contains a certain amount of energy.

Einstein came to this conclusion by thinking about how the energy, E, of an object changes when it is in motion and how there must be some rest energy when a mass, m, is not moving. In our opening lecture, I mentioned the strong nuclear force and how that force holds atoms together. There's energy stored in that. So that's the E and the m of Einstein's famous equation. Lastly, there's c, which is shorthand for the speed of light. We'll get deeper into the speed of light in the next lecture, but for now all you need to know is that it is a very big constant number. It's 3 times 10 to the 8 meters per second. That's a 3 with 8 zeros after it, or 300 million meters traveled every second. That's fast, very fast, and a very high number.

So when you have a mass, even just a small amount, the energy stored there is massive. Massive. Knowing this, scientists after Einstein could calculate that when you break apart atoms, you can release this energy. To get a fairly morbid picture of how much energy can be calculated from even a small amount of mass when you have this enormous speed of light number, recall the hydrogen bomb was approximately 1 teaspoon of matter and the resulting explosion was the amount of energy released from that tiny bit. So a lot of energy.

They kind of reference this mass-energy equivalence in Star Wars The Force Awakens with Starkiller Base. It takes mass from a star and converts it to energy, resulting in a weapon that can take out entire planets.

The funny thing is, the amount of energy stored in the mass of the star would easily take out thousands of planets, not just a few.

Another fundamental explanation in physics that Einstein established, he was a little bit of a show-off for sure, is wave-particle duality.

There was this cool experiment that demonstrated something scientists called the photoelectric effect.
