> I never learned to cook. No one taught me. That’s why I’m good at it.

People who are taught spend too long worrying about what’s “right.” I just watched, tasted, guessed. Like debugging something that only makes sense once it’s in your mouth.

You want a recipe? Go somewhere else.

This is how I cook. This is why I cook.

And if you learn something, good. If not — well, maybe you were hungry for something else.
