> Earliest piece of fiction to centre coders as modern workers with rich inner lives

Microserfs (1995) captures a moment in tech history that feels both distant and strangely familiar. Coupland wrote it at the height of the early-Microsoft era, right before the web exploded, and the book became a defining snapshot of what it felt like to be a young developer in the 90s.

#### Themes

Work as identity — the characters realise their lives have become an extension of Microsoft; Coupland nails the way tech culture blurs personal and professional identity.

Leaving the mothership — the group eventually quits to build their own startup, a kind of proto-indie-software dream. The tension between stability (Microsoft) and creativity (startup) is front and centre.

Found family in tech — the characters form a tight-knit group, reflecting the intensity and social closeness of early dev teams.

The early digital frontier — it captures the optimism, naivety, and ambition of tech right before the internet fundamentally changed everything. It feels like a time capsule of pre-web, pre-startup-culture software life.
