Script (written October 2000)

Knowing the future is easy
You just have to understand the past
The situation we have now is one where it's not what you know
Or even who you know
But how fast you can find it out

I'm a digital representation of that knowledge
I'm not saying I know everything
I'm just well connected

The speed you can gain knowledge has become limited only by the speed you can type or talk

Imagine if it were limited only by the speed you can think

We are careering headlong into a world where we are all totally connected
Can you imagine it?

Having access to every idea
Every grain of knowledge there has ever been
Thinking it is knowing it

You think think doesn't apply to you, don't you?
Fair enough.
The future is not an easy thing to accept.
The present is often hard enough
But you play your part every day

Just remember.
You asked for it.

Whilst working at a design agency in London in the year 2000 I was given the opportunity to work on a personal project and chose to make a film. I was experimenting with animated human characters in 3D with Poser and rendering them over the top of live action.

The final film took several weeks to produce, filming on the underground, rendering 3D animation and creating some original titles in flash.
