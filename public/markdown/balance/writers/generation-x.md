**Brazilification** The widening gulf between the rich and the poor and the accompanying disappearance of the middle classes.

**Vaccinated Time Travel** To fantasize about traveling backward in time, but only with proper vaccinations.

**Decade Blending** In clothing: the indiscriminate combination of two or more items from various decades to create a personal mood: Sheila = Mary Quant earrings (1960s) + cork wedgie platform shoes (1970s) + black leather jacket (1950s and 1980s).

**Emotional Ketchup Burst** The bottling up of opinions and emotions inside oneself so that they explosively burst forth all at once, shocking and confusing employers and friends – most of whom thought things were fine.

**Boomer Envy** Envy of material wealth and long-range material security accrued by older members of the baby boom generation by virtue of fortunate births.

**Power Mist** The tendency of hierarchies in office environments to be diffuse and preclude crisp articulation.

**Overboarding** Overcompensating for fears about the future by plunging headlong into a job or life-style seemingly unrelated to one's previous life interests; i.e., Amway sales, aerobics, the Republican party, a career in law, cults, McJobs.

**Earth Tones** A youthful subgroup interested in vegetarianism, tie-dyed outfits, mild recreational drugs, and good stereo equipment. Earnest, frequently lacking in humor.

The intention is usually to raise enough funds to partake in another, more personally meaningful activity such as watercolor sketching in Crete or designing computer knit sweaters in Hong Kong.

**Celebrity Schadenfreude** Lurid thrills derived from talking about celebrity deaths.

**Architectural Indigestion** The almost obsessive need to live in a "cool" architectural environment. Frequently related objects of fetish include framed black-and-white art photography (Diane Arbus a favorite); simplistic pine furniture; matte black high-tech items such as TVs, stereos, and telephones; low-wattage ambient lighting; a lamp, chair, or table that alludes to the 1950s; cut flowers with complex names.

**Japanese Minimalism** The most frequently offered interior design aesthetic used by rootless career-hopping young people.

**Ultra Short Term Nostalgia** Homesickness for the extremely recent past: "God, things seemed so much better in the world last week.

**Rebellion Postponement** The tendency in one's youth to avoid traditionally youthful activities and artistic experiences in order to obtain serious career experience. Sometimes results in the mourning for lost youth at about age thirty, followed by silly haircuts and expensive joke-inducing wardrobes.

**Conspicuous Minimalism** A life-style tactic similar to Status Substitution. The nonownership of material goods flaunted as a token of moral and intellectual superiority.

**Café Minimalism** To espouse a philosophy of minimalism without actually putting into practice any of its tenets.

**O'Propriation** The inclusion of advertising, packaging, and entertainment jargon from earlier eras in everyday speech for ironic and/or comic effect: "Kathleen's Favorite Dead Celebrity party was tons o' fun" or "Dave really thinks of himself as a zany, nutty, wacky, and madcap guy, doesn't he?"

**Air Family** Describes the false sense of community experienced among coworkers in an office environment.

**Squirming** Discomfort inflicted on young people by old people who see no irony in their gestures. Karen died a thousand deaths as her father made a big show of tasting a recently manufactured bottle of wine before allowing it to be poured as the family sat in Steak Hut.

**Recreational Slumming** The practice of participating in recreational activities of a class one perceives as lower than one's own: "Karen! Donald! Let's go bowling tonight! And don't worry about shoes... apparently you can rent them."

**Conversational Slumming** The self-conscious enjoyment of a given conversation precisely for its lack of intellectual rigor. A major spin-off activity of Recreational Slumming.

**Occupational Slumming** Taking a job well beneath one's skill or education level as a means of retreat from adult responsibilities and/or avoiding possible failure in one's true occupation.

**Anti-victim Device (AVD)** A small fashion accessory worn on an otherwise conservative outfit which announces to the world that one still has a spark of individuality burning inside: 1940s retro ties and earrings (on men), feminist buttons, noserings (women), and the now almost completely extinct teeny weeny "rattail" haircut (both sexes).

**Nutritional Slumming** Food whose enjoyment stems not from flavor but from a complex mixture of class connotations nostalgia signals, and packaging semiotics: Katie and I bought this tub of Multi-Whip instead of real whip cream because we thought petroleum distillate whip topping seemed like the sort of food that air force wives stationed in Pensacola back in the early sixties would feed their husbands to celebrate a career promotion.

**Tele-parablizing** Morals used in everyday life that derive from TV sitcom plots: "That's just like the episode where Jan lost her glasses!

**QFD: Quelle fucking drag** "Jamie got stuck at some airport for thirty-six hours and it was, like, totally QFD."

**QFM: Quelle fashion mistake** "It was really QFM, I mean painter pants? That's 1979 beyond belief.

**Me-ism** A search by an individual, in the absence of training in traditional religious tenets, to formulate a personally tailored religion by himself. Most frequently a mishmash of reincarnation, personal dialogue with a nebulously defined god figure, naturalism, and karmic eye-for-eye attitudes.

**Paper Rabies** Hypersensitivity to littering.

**Bradyism** A multisibling sensibility derived from having grown up in large families. A rarity in those born after approximately 1965, symptoms of Bradyism include a facility for mind games, emotional withdrawal in situations of overcrowding, and a deeply felt need for a well-defined personal space.

**Black Holes** An X generation subgroup best known for their possession of almost entirely black wardrobes. Black Dens: Where Black Holes live; often unheated warehouses with Day-Glo spray painting, mutilated mannequins, Elvis references, dozens of overflowing ashtrays, broken mirror sculptures, and Velvet Underground music playing in background.

**Strangelove Reproduction** Having children to make up for the fact that one no longer believes in the future.

**Squires** The most common X generation subgroup and the only subgroup given to breeding. Squires exist almost exclusively in couples and are recognizable by their frantic attempts to recreate a semblance of Eisenhower-era plenitude in their daily lives in the face of exorbitant housing prices and two-job life-styles. Squires tend to be continually exhausted from their voraciously acquisitive pursuit of furniture and knickknacks.

**Poverty Lurks** Financial paranoia instilled in offspring by depression-era parents.

**Pull-the-plug, Slice the pie** A fantasy in which an offspring mentally tallies up the net worth of his parents.

**Underdogging** The tendency to almost invariably side with the underdog in a given situation. The consumer expression of this trait is the purchasing of less successful, "sad," or failing products: "I know these Vienna franks are heart failure on a stick, but they were so sad looking up against all the other yuppie food items that I just had to buy them.

**2 + 2 = 5-ism** Caving in to a target marketing strategy aimed at oneself after holding out for a long period of time. "Oh, all right, I'll buy your stupid cola. Now leave me alone."

**Option Paralysis** The tendency, when given unlimited choices, to make none.

![Generation X](/webp/coupland/option-paralysis.webp)

**Jack-and-Jill Party** A Squire tradition; baby showers to which both men and women friends are invited as opposed to only women. Doubled purchasing power of bisexual attendance brings gift values up to Eisenhower-era standards.

**Down-nesting** The tendency of parents to move to smaller, guest-room-free houses after the children have moved away so as to avoid children aged 20 to 30 who have boomeranged home.

**Homeowner Envy** Feelings of jealousy generated in the young and the disenfranchised when facing gruesome housing statistics.

**Derision Preemption** A life-style tactic; the refusal to go out on any sort of emotional limb so as to avoid mockery from peers. Derision Preemption is the main goal of Knee-Jerk Irony.

**Green Division** To know the difference between envy and jealousy.

**Knee-Jerk Irony** The tendency to make flippant ironic comments as a reflexive matter of course in everyday conversation.

**Fame-induced Apathy** The attitude that no activity is worth pursuing unless one can become very famous pursuing it. Fame-induced Apathy mimics laziness, but its roots are much deeper.
