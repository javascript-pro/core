### Destructo the Wonderdog

Once upon a time Destructo the Wonderdog and his best mate Barkin’ Boris were hanging out on the mountain. Just sniffing about, play fighting and barking at stuff when suddenly Boris went still as a mouse

"Something’s wrong" he said. "The humans are buggin’"

"What? Eh?" said Wonderdog, grabbing the partially destroyed teddy and giving it a shake to make more stuffing fly

"Pay attention dopey. I think the cats are in trouble. They’re lost"

"Nah. They’re over there in that old suitcase having their cat babies"

"Yeh. We know that. But the humans dun’t. They’re too thick. Just standing about flapping their lips and hands making those squeaky sounds all the damn day. How can we tell ‘em?"

"What would Skippy the Bush Kangaroo do?" Said Wonderdog. The first sensible thing he’s said all day
