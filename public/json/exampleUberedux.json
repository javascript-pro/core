Deep expertise in React, TypeScript, current specialising in Next.js.\n\nRecently, I’ve focused on using AI as a practical development accelerator — not a shortcut, but a force multiplier. With experience and intent, AI generates production-grade results faster and cleaner. Code now ships 2–3x faster with fewer bugs.\n\nProven track record building high-performance UIs, integrating automated testing and linting, and delivering through streamlined pipelines. Equally comfortable leading projects or collaborating in agile teams. Prefer a clear brief, a clean codebase, and a culture that values delivery. Outside work, I write, travel, surf, dive, and ski.\n\n### Skills\n\n- _Specialisms:_ TypeScript Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), React, Node & Next.js\n- _Frameworks & Libraries:_ React, Vue, React Native,
