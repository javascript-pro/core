    "content": "\n> Cixin Liu is a Chinese science-fiction writer best known for The Three-Body Problem and its sequels, collectively The Remembrance of Earth’s Past.\n\n## The Three-Body Problem\n\nFirst contact begins when scientists discover an alien civilisation on the unstable planet Trisolaris. Humanity becomes divided over whether to resist or welcome them.\n\n## The Dark Forest\n\nEarth prepares for the coming Trisolaran invasion. The “Dark Forest Theory” reveals why the universe seems silent—and why contact between civilisations is terrifyingly dangerous.\n\n## Death’s End\n\nThe conflict escalates to cosmic scales. Dimensional warfare, universe-changing technology, and the ultimate fate of humanity and the cosmos come into play.\n\nCixin Liu is significant because he brought Chinese hard sci-fi to a global audience, blending rigorous physics, grand cosmic scale, and philosophical depth. His work revitalised hard sci-fi worldwide, won major awards (including the Hugo), and introduced a distinctly non-Western perspective to the genre’s biggest ideas.\n"

Tend to have doomed and extremely expensive phone-call relationships with people named Serge or llyana.

They're so apathetic. We used to go out and protest. All they do is shop and complain\".\n\n**Consensus Terrorism** The process that decides in-office attitudes and behavior.\n\n**Sick Building Migration** The tendency of younger workers to leave or avoid jobs in unhealthy office environments or workplaces affected by the Sick Building Syndrome.\n\n**Recurving** Leaving one job to take another that pays less but places one back on the learning curve.\n\n**Ozmosis** The inability of one's job to live up to one's self-image.\n\n**Power Mist** The tendency of hierarchies in office environments to be diffuse and preclude crisp articulation.\n\n**Overboarding** Overcompensating for fears about the future by plunging headlong into a job or life-style seemingly unrelated to one's previous life interests; i.e., Amway sales, aerobics, the Republican party, a career in law, cults, McJobs.\n\n**Earth Tones** A youthful subgroup interested in vegetarianism, tie-dyed outfits, mild recreational drugs, and good stereo equipment. Earnest, frequently lacking in humor.\n\n**Ethnomagnetism** The tendency of young people to live in emotionally demonstrative, more unrestrained ethnic neighborhoods: \"You wouldn't understand it there, Mother; they hug where I live now\".\n\n**Mid-twenties Breakdown** A period of mental collapse occurring in one's twenties, often caused by an inability to function outside of school or structured environments coupled with a realization of one's essential aloneness in the world. Often marks induction into the ritual of pharmaceutical usage.\n\n**Successophobia** The fear that if one is successful, then one's personal needs will be forgotten and one will no longer have one's childish needs catered to.\n\n**Safety Net-ism** The belief that there will always be a financial and emotional safety net to buffer life's hurts. Usually parents.\n\n**Divorce Assumption** A form of Safety Net-ism, the belief that if a marriage doesn't work out, then there is no problem because partners can simply seek a divorce.\n\n**Anti-sabbatical** A job taken with the sole intention of staying only for a limited period of time (often one year). The intention is usually to raise enough funds to partake in another, more personally meaningful activity such as watercolor sketching in Crete or designing computer knit sweaters in Hong Kong. Employers are rarely informed of intentions.\n\n**Legislated Nostalgia** To force a body of people to have memories they do not actually possess: \"How can I be a part of the 1960s generation when I don't even remember any of it?\".\n\n**Now Denial** To tell oneself that the only time worth living in is the past and that the only time that may ever be interesting again is the future.\n\n**Dumpster Clocking** The tendency when looking at objects to guesstimate the amount of time they will take to eventually decompose: \"Ski boots are the worst.

Unable to feel rooted in any one environment, they move continually in the hopes of finding an idealized sense of community in the next location.\n\n**Cryptotechnophobia** The secret belief that technology is more of a menace than a boon.\n\n**Virgin Runway** A travel destination chosen in the hopes that no one else has chosen it.\n\n**Native Aping** Pretending to be a native when visiting a foreign destination.\n\n**Expatriate Solipsism** When arriving in a foreign travel destination one had hoped was undiscovered, only to find many people just like oneself; the peeved refusal to talk to said people because they have ruined one's elitist travel fantasy.\n\n**Emallgration** Migration toward lower-tech, lower-information environments containing a lessened emphasis on consumerism.\n\n**Bambification** The mental conversion of flesh-and-blood living creatures into cartoon characters possessing bourgeois Judeo-Christian attitudes and morals.\n\n**Diseases for Kisses (Hyperkarma)** A deeply rooted belief that punishment will somehow always be far greater than the crime: ozone holes for littering.\n\n**Spectacularism** A fascination with extreme situations.\n\n**Lessness** A philosophy whereby one reconciles oneself with diminishing expectations of material wealth: \"I've given up wanting to make a killing or be a bigshot. I just want to find happiness and maybe open up a little roadside cafe in Idaho.\"\n\n**Status Substitution** Using an object with intellectual or fashionable cachet to substitute for an object that is merely pricey: \"Brian, you left your copy of Camus in your brother's BMW.\"\n\n**Survivulousness** The tendency to visualize oneself enjoying being the last remaining person on Earth. \"I'd take a helicopter up and throw microwave ovens down on the Taco Bell.\"\n\n**Platonic Shadow** A nonsexual friendship with a member of the opposite sex.\n\n**Mental Ground Zero** The location where one visualizes oneself during the dropping of the atomic bomb; frequently, a shopping mall.\n\n**Cult of Aloneness** The need for autonomy at all costs, usually at the expense of long-term relationships. Often brought about by overly high expectations of others.\n\n![Generation X](/webp/coupland/cult-of-aloneness.webp)\n\n**Celebrity Schadenfreude** Lurid thrills derived from talking about celebrity deaths.\n\n**The Emperor's New Mall** The popular notion that shopping malls exist on the insides only and have no exterior. The suspension of visual belief engendered by this notion allows shoppers to pretend that the large, cement blocks thrust into their environment do not, in fact, exist.\n\n**Poorochondria** Hypochondria derived from not having medical insurance. Personal Tabu: A small rule for living, bordering on a superstition, that allows one to cope with everyday life in the absence of cultural or religious dictums.\n\n**Architectural Indigestion** The almost obsessive need to live in a \"cool\" architectural environment. Frequently related objects of fetish include framed black-and-white art photography (Diane Arbus a favorite); simplistic pine furniture; matte black high-tech items such as TVs, stereos, and telephones; low-wattage ambient lighting; a lamp, chair, or table that alludes to the 1950s; cut flowers with complex names.\n\n**Japanese Minimalism** The most frequently offered interior design aesthetic used by rootless career-hopping young people.\n\n**Bread and Circuits** The electronic era tendency to view party politics as corny – no longer relevant or meaningful or useful to modern societal issues, and in many cases dangerous.\n\n**Voter's Block** The attempt, however futile, to register dissent with the current political system by simply not voting.\n\n**Armanism** After Giorgio Armani: an obsession with mimicking the seamless and (more importantly) controlled ethos of Italian couture. Like Japanese Minimalism, Armanism reflects a profound inner need for control.\n\n**Poor Buoyancy** The realization that one was a better person when one had less money.\n\n**Musical Hairsplitting** The act of classifying music and musicians into pathologically picayune categories: \"The Vienna Franks are a good example of urban white acid folk revivalism crossed with ska.\"\n\n**101-ism** The tendency to pick apart, often in minute detail, all aspects of life using half-understood pop psychology as a tool.\n\n**Yuppie Wannabes** An X generation subgroup that believes the myth of a yuppie life-style being both satisfying and viable. Tend to be highly in debt, involved in some form of substance abuse, and show a willingness to talk about Armageddon after three drinks.\n\n**Ultra Short Term Nostalgia** Homesickness for the extremely recent past: \"God, things seemed so much better in the world last week.\n\n**Rebellion Postponement** The tendency in one's youth to avoid traditionally youthful activities and artistic experiences in order to obtain serious career experience. Sometimes results in the mourning for lost youth at about age thirty, followed by silly haircuts and expensive joke-inducing wardrobes.\n\n**Conspicuous Minimalism** A life-style tactic similar to Status Substitution. The nonownership of material goods flaunted as a token of moral and intellectual superiority.\n\n**Café Minimalism** To espouse a philosophy of minimalism without actually putting into practice any of its tenets.\n\n**O'Propriation** The inclusion of advertising, packaging, and entertainment jargon from earlier eras in everyday speech for ironic and/or comic effect: \"Kathleen's Favorite Dead Celebrity party was tons o' fun\" or \"Dave really thinks of himself as a zany, nutty, wacky, and madcap guy, doesn't he?\"\n\n**Air Family** Describes the false sense of community experienced among coworkers in an office environment.\n\n**Squirming** Discomfort inflicted on young people by old people who see no irony in their gestures. Karen died a thousand deaths as her father made a big show of tasting a recently manufactured bottle of wine before allowing it to be poured as the family sat in Steak Hut.\n\n**Recreational Slumming** The practice of participating in recreational activities of a class one perceives as lower than one's own: \"Karen! Donald! Let's go bowling tonight! And don't worry about shoes... apparently you can rent them.\"\n\n**Conversational Slumming** The self-conscious enjoyment of a given conversation precisely for its lack of intellectual rigor. A major spin-off activity of Recreational Slumming.\n\n**Occupational Slumming** Taking a job well beneath one's skill or education level as a means of retreat from adult responsibilities and/or avoiding possible failure in one's true occupation.\n\n**Anti-victim Device (AVD)** A small fashion accessory worn on an otherwise conservative outfit which announces to the world that one still has a spark of individuality burning inside: 1940s retro ties and earrings (on men), feminist buttons, noserings (women), and the now almost completely extinct teeny weeny \"rattail\" haircut (both sexes).\n\n**Nutritional Slumming** Food whose enjoyment stems not from flavor but from a complex mixture of class connotations nostalgia signals, and packaging semiotics: Katie and I bought this tub of Multi-Whip instead of real whip cream because we thought petroleum distillate whip topping seemed like the sort of food that air force wives stationed in Pensacola back in the early sixties would feed their husbands to celebrate a career promotion.\n\n**Tele-parablizing** Morals used in everyday life that derive from TV sitcom plots: \"That's just like the episode where Jan lost her glasses!\n\n**QFD: Quelle fucking drag** \"Jamie got stuck at some airport for thirty-six hours and it was, like, totally QFD.\"\n\n**QFM: Quelle fashion mistake** \"It was really QFM, I mean painter pants? That's 1979 beyond belief.\n\n**Me-ism** A search by an individual, in the absence of training in traditional religious tenets, to formulate a personally tailored religion by himself. Most frequently a mishmash of reincarnation, personal dialogue with a nebulously defined god figure, naturalism, and karmic eye-for-eye attitudes.\n\n**Paper Rabies** Hypersensitivity to littering.\n\n**Bradyism** A multisibling sensibility derived from having grown up in large families. A rarity in those born after approximately 1965, symptoms of Bradyism include a facility for mind games, emotional withdrawal in situations of overcrowding, and a deeply felt need for a well-defined personal space.\n\n**Black Holes** An X generation subgroup best known for their possession of almost entirely black wardrobes. Black Dens: Where Black Holes live; often unheated warehouses with Day-Glo spray painting, mutilated mannequins, Elvis references, dozens of overflowing ashtrays, broken mirror sculptures, and Velvet Underground music playing in background.\n\n**Strangelove Reproduction** Having children to make up for the fact that one no longer believes in the future.\n\n**Squires** The most common X generation subgroup and the only subgroup given to breeding. Squires exist almost exclusively in couples and are recognizable by their frantic attempts to recreate a semblance of Eisenhower-era plenitude in their daily lives in the face of exorbitant housing prices and two-job life-styles. Squires tend to be continually exhausted from their voraciously acquisitive pursuit of furniture and knickknacks.\n\n**Poverty Lurks** Financial paranoia instilled in offspring by depression-era parents.\n\n**Pull-the-plug, Slice the pie** A fantasy in which an offspring mentally tallies up the net worth of his parents.\n\n**Underdogging** The tendency to almost invariably side with the underdog in a given situation. The consumer expression of this trait is the purchasing of less successful, \"sad,\" or failing products: \"I know these Vienna franks are heart failure on a stick, but they were so sad looking up against all the other yuppie food items that I just had to buy them.\n\n**2 + 2 = 5-ism** Caving in to a target marketing strategy aimed at oneself after holding out for a long period of time. \"Oh, all right, I'll buy your stupid cola. Now leave me alone.\"\n\n**Option Paralysis** The tendency, when given unlimited choices, to make none.\n\n![Generation X](/webp/coupland/option-paralysis.webp)\n\n**Personality Tithe** A price paid for becoming a couple; previously amusing human beings become boring: \"Thanks for inviting us, but Noreen and I are going to look at flatware catalogs tonight. Afterward we're going to watch the shopping channel.\"\n\n**Jack-and-Jill Party** A Squire tradition; baby showers to which both men and women friends are invited as opposed to only women. Doubled purchasing power of bisexual attendance brings gift values up to Eisenhower-era standards.\n\n**Down-nesting** The tendency of parents to move to smaller, guest-room-free houses after the children have moved away so as to avoid children aged 20 to 30 who have boomeranged home.\n\n**Homeowner Envy** Feelings of jealousy generated in the young and the disenfranchised when facing gruesome housing statistics.\n\n**Derision Preemption** A life-style tactic; the refusal to go out on any sort of emotional limb so as to avoid mockery from peers. Derision Preemption is the main goal of Knee-Jerk Irony.\n\n**Green Division** To know the difference between envy and jealousy.\n\n**Knee-Jerk Irony** The tendency to make flippant ironic comments as a reflexive matter of course in everyday conversation.\n\n**Fame-induced Apathy** The attitude that no activity is worth pursuing unless one can become very famous pursuing it. Fame-induced Apathy mimics laziness, but its roots are much deeper.\n"

    "content": "\n> Earliest piece of fiction to centre coders as modern workers with rich inner lives\n\nMicroserfs (1995) captures a moment in tech history that feels both distant and strangely familiar. Coupland wrote it at the height of the early-Microsoft era, right before the web exploded, and the book became a defining snapshot of what it felt like to be a young developer in the 90s.\n\n#### Themes\n\nWork as identity — the characters realise their lives have become an extension of Microsoft; Coupland nails the way tech culture blurs personal and professional identity.\n\nLeaving the mothership — the group eventually quits to build their own startup, a kind of proto-indie-software dream. The tension between stability (Microsoft) and creativity (startup) is front and centre.\n\nFound family in tech — the characters form a tight-knit group, reflecting the intensity and social closeness of early dev teams.\n\nThe early digital frontier — it captures the optimism, naivety, and ambition of tech right before the internet fundamentally changed everything. It feels like a time capsule of pre-web, pre-startup-culture software life.\n"

    "tags": [],
    "content": "\n> \"Lemonading\" is an actual word that even people on Radio 4 use. So when life gives you lemons...\n\n### Ingredients\n\n#### For the pastry\n\n- 4 oz (110 g) plain flour, plus a little extra for rolling out\n- a pinch of salt\n- 1 oz (25 g) softened butter, cut into smallish lumps\n- 1 oz (25 g) softened pure lard, cut into smallish lumps\n\n#### For the filling\n\n- Grated zest and juice 2 large lemons\n- 3 level tablespoons cornflour\n- 2 oz (50 g) golden caster sugar\n- 3 large egg yolks\n- 1½ oz (40 g) butter\n\n#### For the meringue\n\n- 3 large egg whites\n- 6 oz (175 g) golden caster sugar\n\n### Method\n\nStart by making the pastry.\n\nFirst sieve the flour and a pinch of salt into a large bowl, holding the sieve up high to give the flour a good airing. Then add the butter and lard and, using only your fingertips, lightly rub the fats into the flour, again lifting the mixture up high. When everything is crumbly, sprinkle in 1 tablespoon of water. Start to mix the pastry with a flat-bladed knife and then finish off with your hands, adding a few more drops of water until you have a smooth dough that will leave the bowl clean. Then pop the pastry into a plastic bag and let it rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.\n\nNext, transfer the pastry to a flat, lightly floured surface and roll it out to a circle about ½ in (1 cm) larger all round than the rim of the tin. Cut a ½ in (1 cm) strip from the edge of the pastry, dampen the rim of the tin with water and fix the strip round it, pressing down well. Dampen the strip before lining the tin with the pastry circle, making sure you don't trap any air underneath it. Then prick the base all over with a fork. Place the tin on the baking sheet and bake on a high shelf in the pre-heated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until cooked through. After that, remove the pastry case from the oven and immediately lower the heat to gas mark 2, 300°F (150°C) for the meringue.\n\nMeanwhile, make the filling. Measure 10 fl oz (275 ml) cold water into a jug, and spoon the cornflour and sugar into a bowl. Add enough of the water to mix the cornflour to a smooth paste, then pour the rest of the water, along with the grated lemon zest, into a small saucepan. Bring this up to the boil, then pour it gradually on to the cornflour, mixing all the time until it is smooth. Now return the mixture to the saucepan and bring it back to the boil still mixing. Next, simmer very gently for about a minute stirring all the time to prevent it from catching. Then remove the pan from the heat and beat in the egg yolks, lemon juice and lastly, the butter. Now pour the lemon mixture into the pastry shell and spread it out evenly.\n\nFinally, for the meringue, use a large, spanking clean, grease-fee bowl and in it whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Now beat in a quarter of the sugar at a time until it is all incorporated, then spoon the meringue on top of the pie, taking it to the very edge of the pastry rim with a palette knife, so that it seals the edge completely (You can also make a few decorative swirls).\n\nBake in the oven on the centre shelf for 45 minutes, by which time the meringue will have turned pale beige, and be crisp on the outside and squashy within. Serve warm or cold, but if warm, leave it to settle for about 20 minutes. Chilled pouring cream is a nice accompaniment.\n\n#### Additional\n\nPre-heat the oven to gas mark 5, 375°F (190°C).\n\n#### Equipment\n\nYou will also need a 1.5 inch (4 cm) deep, sloping-sided, non-stick pie tin with a ½ in (1 cm) rim, a base diameter of 7in (18 cm) and a top diameter of 9½ in (24 cm)\n"

Often enriched with prawns, chicken, or beef. Usually finished with prawn crackers a fried egg and a side of crisp cucumber\n\nIf you are also [Generation X](/balance/books/douglas-coupland/generation-x) then maybe you travelled in Indonesia and remember Nasi Goreng as being the most delisious thing in the world ever, but you've never been able to recreate it?\n\nExtra Doubleplus Bonus for having either or both of these specialist ingredients which would _really_ seal the flavour deal and take you back to climbing Mt Rinjani on Lombok.\n\n## Main flavours\n\n- Sweet and sticky from kecap manis\n- Umami and slight funk from shrimp paste\n- Heat from chillies\n- Aromatics from garlic and shallot\n- A little tang from tamarind or lime\n\n### Kecap manis\n\nIndonesian sweet soy sauce. Thick, glossy, caramel-like, and built from soy sauce reduced with palm sugar plus aromatics (garlic, star anise, galangal, bay leaf).\n\n### Nasi Goreng paste\n\nNasi Goreng paste is a concentrated seasoning blend used to build the core flavour of Indonesian fried rice. It usually contains sweet soy sauce (kecap manis), garlic, shallot, chilli, tamarind, shrimp paste, and warm spices such as coriander and galangal. It gives the dish its deep caramel colour and the balance of sweet, savoury, spicy, and smoky-fermented notes.\n\n#### How to use the paste\n\nYou fry the paste first. A teaspoon or two goes into hot oil so it can cook out, darken slightly, and perfume the pan. Once fragrant, you add protein and vegetables, then finally cold cooked rice so the paste coats the grains evenly. A splash of kecap manis at the end tightens the colour and seasoning.\n\n#### How not to use the paste\n\n- Adding the paste too late: you end up with raw, harsh flavours.\n- Using warm or freshly cooked rice: it turns mushy instead of smoky and separate.\n- Using too much paste: the dish becomes cloying, overly sweet, or sludge-like.\n\nIf you want to recreate authentically traditional Nasi Goreng from scratch,first have a chinese the night before. There's always some berk who's ordered too much rice and nobody likes cold boily rice hanging round the fridge\n\nHere's what you also kind of need.

When I joined the Sydney tech team in 2018, the company was mid-transformation. Full of talented people and legacy systems coexisting.\n\nI joined a strong Agile team led by a Product Owner, who had assembled a cross-functional group of contractors to form a kind of rapid-prototyping unit. We had solid backend engineers, frontend specialists, and everything in between — all focused on exploring new ways to bring Boral’s data to life.\n\nThe challenge was typical of a large enterprise: years of evolving microservices, inconsistent versioning, and fragmented data sources. We turned to GraphQL to unify those systems — collating information from multiple APIs and delivering it cleanly to the frontend.\n\nOur focus was a real-time geo-spatial prototype, powered by data streamed from smartphones across a fleet of 200+ vehicles nationwide. The goal was simple but powerful: grab the live location data, enrich it with contextual information, and display it beautifully on a map.\n\nVoila. Dots on a Map. A functional prototype ready for the governance board to explore and iterate on.\n\n### What I Brought to the Team\n\n- **Captain’s Duty** – times I took ownership, showed integrity, and followed through without being asked\n\nWhen communication gaps emerged between our frontend and backend engineers particularly between our young Chinese frontend developer and her backend counterpart. I suggested they use GraphQL as their shared language. This bridge helped them collaborate effectively, freeing me to focus on state management, ensuring every component aligned into a cohesive working app.\n\n- **Fun Loving Heart** How I brought positive energy, supported teammates, and helped create an enjoyable, hard-working environment?\n\nThe first time we actually tested the App fully I rode home with a smartphone in my pocket which the product owner showed his bosses the little icon of my bike heading to Narrabeen\n\n- **Athlete’s Grit** – examples of when I pushed through challenges and delivered under pressure?\n\nObviously in such an environment priorities can change daily and keeping flexible to those changes is a full time job\n\n#### Technical Highlights\n\n- Established foundational test architecture using Cucumber, Gherkin, and BDD principles\n- Developed and tested multiple React PWAs with AWS Amplify and GraphQL\n- Built CI/CD workflows to support rapid feature delivery and iterative feedback loops\n"

    "content": "\n> We don't use cookies\n\n## Cookies\n\nWhile cookies have been a fundamental part of web development for many years and continue to serve important functions, there are some considerations that might lead developers to explore alternative approaches or supplementary technologies. Here are a few reasons why some developers might consider cookies as \"old-fashioned\" and explore alternatives:\n\n1. **Privacy Concerns:** Cookies are often associated with privacy concerns because they can be used to track users across different websites. In an era where privacy is a growing concern, some users are wary of being tracked online. Developers may explore alternative solutions that respect user privacy better.\n\n2. **Limited Storage:** Cookies have a size limit (typically around 4KB), which can be a constraint when developers need to store larger sets of data. For more complex applications with substantial data requirements, developers might turn to other technologies that offer more extensive storage options.\n\n3. **Security Issues:** While cookies can be secure, they are still susceptible to certain types of attacks, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Some developers may opt for newer technologies with built-in security cartridges or explore ways to enhance cookie security.\n\n4. **Stateless Nature:** Cookies are stateful and rely on the client-side to store information. For stateless applications or those embracing more modern architecture patterns like serverless or microservices, developers might explore stateless alternatives or leverage technologies that allow for centralized state management.\n\n5. **User Experience:** Cookies may contribute to a slightly slower user experience because they are transmitted with every HTTP request. In scenarios where minimizing latency is crucial, developers might explore technologies that can achieve similar functionalities with reduced overhead.\n\nIt's important to note that while cookies have their limitations, they remain a versatile and widely used tool in web development. Developers often make choices based on the specific needs of their projects, considering factors such as user experience, security, and privacy. If your goal is to reduce reliance on cookies, consider exploring technologies like Web Storage, Session Storage, IndexedDB, or modern web standards like the Web Storage API or the Fetch API as alternatives or complements. Always keep in mind the specific requirements and constraints of your project when choosing the right tool for the job.\n\n**Privacy Statement**\n\nWelcome to Goldlabel.

When demand grows, you can simply add another server or upgrade to a more powerful blade without redesigning the setup.\n\nIn short:  \nStart with a solid, entry‑level server from a reputable brand like Dell. It keeps costs down, deployment fast, and future scaling simple.\n"

    "content": "\n### A ring‑fenced LLM is like having the power of AI inside a locked room\n\nIt can process sensitive documents and assist with legal work, but nothing ever leaves the firm’s secure network.

    "tags": "abgeschottet, KI",
    "content": "\n### How does the AI learn from the prompts over time?\n\n> Used carefully, large language models can turn legal research into a faster, more focused process.\n\nWhen we talk about learning, it’s important to distinguish between two very different concepts:\n\n#### 1. The model itself is frozen\n\nThe underlying neural network weights of the Phi‑3 model do not change as you interact with it. Prompting alone does not permanently add knowledge.  \nTo truly alter the model, you would need to perform a separate fine‑tuning process, which involves preparing a large dataset and training new weights or adapters.\n\n#### 2. Building memory outside the model\n\nInstead of changing the model, we store and reuse context. This is often done with a technique called retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG).\n\nHow it works in Abgeschottet KI:\n\n- Every prompt and its answer can be saved in a database (for example, SQLite).\n- When a new prompt comes in, we search our stored history for relevant past prompts and answers.\n- We then feed those relevant snippets back into the model as additional context.\n\nThis gives the effect that the model is _learning over time_, even though the model itself remains unchanged.\n\n#### 3. Fine‑tuning (optional, advanced)\n\nIf you ever want to truly expand the model’s built‑in knowledge, you can create a fine‑tuning dataset and train new adapters or weights. This is a separate process that produces a new version of the model to load into your ring‑fenced environment.\n\n#### 4. Practical takeaway\n\nFor Abgeschottet KI, the recommended path is to:\n\n- Store prompt/response history in your database.\n- Use similarity search to retrieve the most relevant past data.\n- Inject those results into each new prompt.\n\nThis approach avoids retraining costs and keeps the system ring‑fenced, while still improving results over time.\n"

It automates repetitive coding, generates boilerplate, and quickly produces prototypes that would otherwise take weeks.\n\nDocumentation, testing, and debugging are streamlined by tools that can spot errors or suggest fixes instantly. Even design and architecture benefit from AI’s ability to analyze patterns and propose solutions.\n\nThe biggest time savings come from:\n\n- Faster coding – AI can write functions, components, and tests in seconds.\n- Reduced overhead – less time spent on coordination, hand-offs, and project management.\n- Accelerated learning – developers don’t need to research for hours; they can ask the AI and get tailored guidance immediately.\n- Iterative speed – prototypes and revisions happen much faster, compressing months of iteration into weeks.\n\nIn short, AI reduces friction across the lifecycle, letting a single developer achieve the output of an entire team.\n"

If Singularity is the point at which the machines take over, it's the bad thing. It's Skynet, it's Asimov, it's Arthur C Clarke, it's the end of the world. We've recently invented Large Language Models (LLM) which make things like ChatGPT work.\n\nGive it a text prompt and out comes human-like language. No sensible person has a clue how it really does that, but it must do because it’s doing it right in front of our eyes. That is wizardry. Now change the word Language to the words Human Behavior. Apply the above wizardry and you have an AI which teaches itself to predict and emulate human behaviour.\n\nSome experts believe that deploying AI like that to a drone with a gun might be a bad idea.\n\n### Here comes the science bit\n\n![Jennifer Aniston, in different L'Oreal Elvive adverts](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53669711572_3547fb59b2_z.jpg)\n\n> If challenged to explain this silly idea using actual brain knowledge, this is how AI works\n\n### Neural Networks\n\nAIs use sophisticated types of artificial neural networks that are capable of processing sequential and non-sequential data, capturing the nuances of human behavior across different contexts\n\nUnsupervised learning is key because it allows the model to learn from raw behavioral data without needing predefined labels or categories\n\n### New data\n\nAIs are trained using extensive datasets of human behavior. This data comes from videos, CCTV, IoT sensor data, social media activity, and other records of human actions\n\nUnderstanding Context: As the model processes this data, it learns to predict behaviors in certain situations based on previous observations. This process is driven by unsupervised learning, where the model identifies patterns and relationships in the data on its own, without explicit guidance on what to learn\n\n### Self Supervision\n\nThe model is given scenarios with partial data or hypothetical situations and asked to predict outcomes based on learned behaviors. It’s like observing a scene in a movie and guessing what a character will do next based on their past actions\n\n### Fine Tuning\n\nAfter the initial broad training, the model could be fine-tuned with specific types of behavioral data or for particular applications, such as understanding customer behavior in business settings or aiding in psychological analysis\n\n### Additional Training\n\nBy incorporating new and diverse behavioral data over time, the model can adapt to changes in human behavior and understand new patterns that emerge\n\n### Feedback Loops\n\nFeedback from users and behavioral scientists can help refine the model's predictions and make it more attuned to subtle nuances in human behavior\n\n### Architectural & Algorithmic Updates\n\nOngoing research in neural network design and learning algorithms can enhance how AIs process and learn from behavioral data, improving their predictive accuracy and applicability in real-world scenarios\n\n### Drones\n\nFor a few thousand quid you could probably put together a drone with a 3D printed gun and a Raspberry Pi to run the AI needed to pilot it autonomously. It'll be connected to the main AI Hive mind of course. It will use the mobile networks for that\n"

    "content": "\n# Blockchain Crypto Casino\n\n> In 2023, I joined a small iGaming startup in Malta focused on developing a fully anonymous, provably fair crypto casino. The company was founded by veterans of the online gambling world but was pivoting into blockchain as a way to skirt regulatory overhead and payment processor restrictions.\n\nThe idea was to create a casino that ran entirely on Bitcoin. Players didn’t need to sign up with an email, provide any personal information, or go through a bank. They could simply send Bitcoin to the site, play games, and withdraw any winnings — all in a matter of minutes.\n\n### Key features\n\n- WebSocket-driven live play (e.g., roulette, dice)\n- Bitcoin deposits & withdrawals via ElectrumX\n- In-browser entropy generation for provable fairness\n- Session-based wallets with automatic hot-wallet sweeping\n\n### My Role\n\nWhile I wasn’t the lead, I worked closely with the CTO to build out the frontend and middleware layers. This included integrating live WebSocket games, connecting to Electrum servers for blockchain transaction monitoring, and helping define the client API contract.\n\nI also helped with:\n\n- Creating a responsive React UI for multiple games\n- Implementing realtime transaction feedback via WebSockets\n- Writing middleware to validate Bitcoin deposit addresses\n- Working on wallet entropy sources for provable fairness\n\n### Technical Challenges\n\n- **Latency**: Keeping gameplay snappy while querying Bitcoin balances over Electrum\n- **Security**: Preventing double spends and replay attacks\n- **UX**: Explaining trustless randomness to non-technical users\n- **Architecture**: Designing microservices to isolate financial logic\n\n### Outcome\n\nThe platform launched in private beta and attracted a small but active cohort of users — mostly from forums and crypto communities. Due to legal ambiguity and lack of licensing, the company eventually wound down operations voluntarily.\n\nStill, it served as a successful proof-of-concept for anonymous, crypto-native gaming.\n\n### Reflections\n\nThis project taught me how to move fast in an unregulated space — balancing engineering idealism with pragmatic risk. It also gave me early exposure to the realities of building with Bitcoin: slow confirmation times, Electrum quirks, and the limitations of designing around unfinalized transactions.\n\nIt’s also a great reminder of what you _can_ build when traditional financial rails are removed from the equation.\n\n### Technical Assessment\n\nBefore joining the team, I completed a technical assessment to demonstrate my understanding of Bitcoin fundamentals and general coding ability. The task involved working directly with Bitcoin hashing algorithms — a core concept behind how transactions are verified on the blockchain.\n\nThe code is here on [GitHub](https://github.com/javascript-pro/bitcoin-hash). While it’s a simple project, it reflects the kind of low-level thinking and hands-on problem solving that this space often demands.\n"

It includes UI elements like buttons, forms, and typography, along with rules for layout, spacing, and interaction patterns. The goal is consistency—both in user experience and in how teams design and build interfaces.\n\n#### Why Use a Design System?\n\nUsing a design system ensures that everyone—from designers to developers—speaks the same visual language. It speeds up development, reduces duplication, and keeps interfaces accessible and cohesive across platforms. It also scales well. As teams grow, a design system helps maintain quality and coherence without slowing down progress.\n\n#### Why Material Design?\n\nWe chose Material Design because it’s a battle-tested system backed by Google, with strong support across platforms. It comes with thoughtful defaults, clear accessibility standards, and a broad set of ready-to-use components. More importantly, it's flexible. Material adapts well to different brand identities, making it a solid foundation for custom styling while keeping UX best practices baked in.\n"

Trends rise, crash, and return again under a different name.\n\nWhat’s remained consistent is this: the best software comes from open collaboration.\n\n### Open Source Makes Us Sharper\n\nEvery time we publish a piece of code publicly, we’re saying _this is good enough to stand on its own_.\n\nThat raises the bar for how we work. Our interfaces get clearer. Our naming gets tighter. Our patterns get simpler. Writing code that others can understand forces us to think in terms that last.\n\nAnd when someone opens an issue or submits a pull request, we learn. That’s a gift.\n\n### Open Source Makes Us Faster\n\nWe reuse what we build.\n\nBy open-sourcing common utilities, design components, and workflows, we cut down the overhead of spinning up new projects. Whether we’re building an internal tool or a client-facing app, we pull from the same shared libraries—kept clean and documented because they’re public.\n\nOur stack gets stronger with every project.\n\n### Open Source Builds Trust\n\nWhen a client or collaborator can see exactly how a feature is built, it changes the conversation.\n\nWe’re not hiding behind buzzwords. We’re showing our work. That transparency builds confidence—and often sparks better ideas from the people we’re working with.\n\nWe believe in solving problems out in the open, not behind closed doors.\n\n### Open Source Powers the Future\n\nMost of the tools we rely on—React, Next.js, Firebase, MUI—exist because someone decided to open source their work.\n\nWe give back because we’re part of that ecosystem. It’s how the web moves forward.\n\nWhen we publish something as Open Source, it’s an invitation: _take this, improve it, make it yours_.\n\n### What We Open Source\n\n- _Core UI libraries_ used across our products\n- _Markdown-based content loaders_ and site generators\n- _PWA boilerplates_ and frontend architecture patterns\n- _Weekend Portfolio apps_—real, working projects anyone can use or remix\n- ...and more, as we go\n\nWe build in the open because it makes our work better.\n\nIf something you see sparks an idea, run with it.

    "content": "\n> Three.js rewards experience. With two decades of JS and deep React/Next.js knowledge, you can transform a blank canvas into a highly optimized, interactive, and visually rich web experience—without compromises.\n\n#### Why a Senior JS Developer Should Care\n\nFor a developer with decades of experience in JavaScript, React, and Next.js, Three.js isn’t just another graphics library—it’s a **power tool** for web experiences that push beyond traditional DOM boundaries.\n\n#### What Three.js Offers\n\n- **Full control over rendering**  \n  Unlike engines that hide complexity, Three.js exposes the entire rendering pipeline. You control cameras, lights, shaders, post-processing, and object hierarchies. If you’re comfortable architecting large React/Next.js apps, you’ll appreciate the freedom to design your own 3D scene graph and state flow.\n\n- **Extensible and modular**  \n  Three.js doesn’t dictate how you structure your app. You can integrate it with:\n\n  - **React Three Fiber (R3F)** for declarative scene management in React\n  - **Zustand, Jotai, Redux** for state\n  - **Custom loaders and shaders** for advanced PBR, glTF, or procedural content\n\n- **Modern Web API support**\n\n  - **WebGL2** is stable and mature\n  - **WebGPU** is emerging, and Three.js already supports it experimentally\n  - Works with WebXR for AR/VR experiences\n\n- **Rich ecosystem**\n\n  - Loaders for glTF, OBJ, FBX, and more\n  - Post-processing effects, physics integration (ammo.js, cannon.js)\n  - Scene exporters, asset pipelines, and a large repository of community examples\n\n- **Interoperability with Next.js**  \n  You can seamlessly combine Three.js with server-side rendering and React components, allowing dynamic content overlays, route-based scene loading, and static generation of 3D assets or thumbnails.\n\n#### Why It’s Worth Your Time\n\nFor a senior React developer, Three.js is like switching from a high-level framework to a low-level graphics API with a safety net:\n\n- **Total flexibility**: Build custom UI/UX that feels native and interactive.\n- **Performance mastery**: Direct access to GPU rendering lets you optimize far beyond what pre-packaged engines allow.\n- **Future-proofing**: Learn WebGPU workflows now while keeping WebGL2 fallbacks.\n- **Creative freedom**: Procedural worlds, physics-driven interactions, generative art—all without engine-imposed constraints.\n\n#### When to Choose Three.js\n\n- You want **React-style control** over every detail of the scene\n- You’re comfortable **building scaffolding** for state, loaders, and assets\n- You’re targeting **bespoke web experiences**, not just “games in a box”\n- You want **long-term flexibility** and the ability to scale projects beyond standard demos\n"

Bandwidth and processors simply couldn’t keep up. That has changed.\n\nAfter two decades, the web has finally reached the point I imagined back in the 90s. Delivering real-time, interactive 3D experiences to any browser is no longer an experiment — it’s a practical, deployable reality.\n\n#### Timeline of 3D on the Web\n\n- **Mid-90s (56k era)** – VRML promised a “metaverse,” but on dial-up it was little more than wireframes crawling down the screen. At that point, the only way to experiment with 3D was offline. I remember getting a copy of **Poser** bundled with some software I bought. I used it to put together a short animated film — rough by today’s standards, but my first hands-on 3D work. Streaming that kind of content through a browser wasn’t even conceivable.\n\n- **Early 2000s** – Flash offered limited 3D effects, mostly sprite-based tricks. I built interactive demos using Papervision3D, testing the limits of what Flash could do. It looked impressive to users, but under the hood it was a lot of workaround and compromise.\n\n- **Java Applets / Shockwave 3D** – Plug-ins allowed real 3D, but adoption was low. Users didn’t want to install extra software, and consumer hardware couldn’t reliably handle complex scenes. I experimented with Java 3D applets, seeing firsthand how performance could kill an experience instantly.\n\n- **2011** – WebGL arrives. Native 3D in the browser, powered by the GPU. I jumped in immediately, writing raw WebGL code and feeling the power — but also the pain. The learning curve was steep, and most developers stuck to demos rather than production work.\n\n- **2013–2016** – Libraries like **Three.js** and **Babylon.js** matured. They abstracted boilerplate, made the browser approachable for real 3D projects, and finally allowed me to focus on design and interaction rather than low-level graphics plumbing.\n\n- **2016+** – WebVR and WebXR appear. Mobile GPUs improve. I started testing immersive experiences, from simple VR viewers to AR prototypes, seeing the web catch up to what native apps had offered for years.\n\n- **2020s** – WebAssembly, faster GPUs in every device, and **WebGPU** arrive. Performance bottlenecks are fading. Today, web-delivered 3D is production-ready, with frameworks that let developers move fast and focus on content, not infrastructure.\n\n> For **control, longevity, and custom UX**, pick **Three.js**. Assemble your own stack (R3F, Zustand/Jotai, glTF toolchain, physics/post-processing). The early investment pays off in flexibility and scale.\n\nWeb 3D has matured over the last two decades, and today there’s a variety of libraries and engines, each with different trade-offs. Here’s a concise comparison.\n\n- **Three.js**\n\n  - **What it is:** Low-level rendering library (WebGL2/WebGPU)\n  - **Strengths:** Maximum control, huge community, works well with React (R3F)\n  - **Trade-offs:** You build everything yourself (asset pipeline, state, tooling)\n  - **When to use:** You want full control; “React over Angular” approach—harder upfront, but scales with ambition\n\n- **Babylon.js**\n\n  - **What it is:** Full-featured 3D engine\n  - **Strengths:** Fast to production for game-like apps, batteries-included features, strong WebGPU/WGSL support\n  - **Trade-offs:** More framework conventions\n  - **When to use:** You need engine features out-of-box and faster iteration\n\n- **PlayCanvas**\n\n  - **What it is:** Open-source engine + hosted browser editor\n  - **Strengths:** Team-friendly, easy asset workflows, collaborative editor\n  - **Trade-offs:** Complex customizations heavier than Three.js\n  - **When to use:** Teams wanting quick iteration and hosted pipeline\n\n- **CesiumJS**\n  - **What it is:** Globe/geospatial specialist\n  - **Strengths:** Best for planet-scale streaming, terrain, photogrammetry, 3D Tiles\n  - **Trade-offs:** Not a general-purpose engine\n  - **When to use:** You need large-scale geospatial visualization\n\n## Core standards shaping web 3D\n\n- **glTF 2.0** – standard format for assets and PBR materials; widely supported across engines.\n- **WebGPU** – stable in Chrome/Edge, Firefox on Windows, Safari behind flag; Three.js and Babylon.js have early WebGPU support. Keep WebGL2 fallback for now.\n"

It’s become an essential tool in our daily workflow—one of those rare bits of software that’s genuinely a joy to use. Fast, cross-platform, and beautifully designed, it takes the friction out of managing repos, branches, and merges.\n\nWe’ve used GitKraken for years. It simplifies the parts of Git that usually trip people up—resolving conflicts, visualising history, managing remotes—and does it all with a clean interface that doesn’t get in your way.\n\nRecently, GitKraken added a feature that uses generative AI to write commit messages and pull request descriptions. And honestly, it’s brilliant.\n\nHaving meaningful commit messages and PR summaries isn't just good practice. It saves time, especially when someone (often a manager or another dev trying to understand your code from a distance) comes snooping through your Git history.\n\nLet’s be honest—Git logs aren’t always written for clarity. With AI helping shape the language, the result is more consistent, more readable, and occasionally even insightful. This doesn’t just make your work look more polished; it also helps when switching context, onboarding new developers, or retracing steps months later.\n\n### Why It Matters\n\nGitKraken isn’t trying to replace Git—it’s helping you use it better. And now, it’s helping you communicate better. That’s the part most people underestimate in software: how well your tools let your team understand what’s going on.\n\nWith GitKraken, you get clarity, speed, and now, a little help from AI to sound more professional in your commits and pull requests. We recommend it without hesitation.\n"

Torvalds, needing a fast, distributed alternative, designed Git with a few key principles:\n\n- Speed — handle large codebases like Linux efficiently\n- Distributed architecture — every clone is a full repository\n- Integrity — cryptographic tracking via SHA-1 hashes\n- Simple branching/merging — enable experimentation\n\nSoon after, the open-source community (notably Junio C Hamano) helped mature Git into the robust system it is today.\n\n#### GitHub: Collaboration Layer (2008)\n\nGitHub launched in April 2008, founded by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, PJ Hyett, and Scott Chacon. Their vision: make Git usable and social — a Facebook for code. Key innovations:\n\n- Easy repository hosting and web-based UI for Git\n- Pull requests, issues, wikis, and CI integrations\n- Social features: stars, followers, and activity feeds\n\nGitHub rapidly became the go-to platform for open-source projects, startups, and enterprises alike.\n"

Using tools like Jest for unit and integration tests and Playwright for end-to-end browser testing, issues are caught as code is written rather than after release. This reduces rework, improves reliability, and keeps delivery cycles fast and confident. It’s about building quality in from the start, not inspecting it in at the end.\n\n## JavaScript & Web Testing Framework Timeline\n\n#### 1995–2000: The Early Manual Era\n\nContext: JavaScript emerged (1995, Brendan Eich).\n\nTesting: Almost all testing was manual — clicking through browsers, logging to console.\n\nNo formal frameworks; developers used ad hoc scripts or shell tools.\n\n#### 2001 – JUnit & the xUnit Influence\n\nCreator: Kent Beck (Java, 1997–2001 evolution).\n\nWhy it matters: The xUnit model (Arrange–Act–Assert) became the template for all testing frameworks to follow — including JS.\n\nFocus: Unit testing and TDD mindset.\n\nImpact: Inspired early JS frameworks like JsUnit and QUnit.\n\n#### 2005 – JsUnit\n\nCreator: Edward Hieatt and others at Pivotal Labs.\n\nWhat it did: The first structured JS testing framework based on JUnit principles.\n\nGood for: Early unit testing in browsers — before Node existed.\n\n#### 2008 – QUnit\n\nCreator: Developed by John Resig (creator of jQuery) and the jQuery team.\n\nGood for: Testing frontend logic in jQuery-heavy apps.\n\nWhy it mattered: Simple assertions, browser-based runner, made testability part of frontend culture.\n\n#### 2010 – Node.js + CommonJS Testing Revolution\n\nContext: Node.js launched in 2009; backend JS testing became possible.\n\nFrameworks emerged:\n\nVows (2010) – asynchronous testing for Node.\n\nExpresso (2010) – early minimalist BDD runner for Node.\n\nThese laid groundwork for Mocha and Jasmine.\n\n#### 2011 – Jasmine\n\nCreator: Pivotal Labs.\n\nFocus: Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) syntax — “describe / it / expect.”\n\nGood for: Unit and integration testing of browser and Node apps.\n\nWhy it mattered: Removed the need for a DOM; clean syntax; widely adopted in AngularJS world.\n\n#### 2011 – Mocha\n\nCreator: TJ Holowaychuk.\n\nFocus: Flexible testing framework with async support and plugin ecosystem.\n\nGood for: Backend (Node) and later frontend testing with tools like Chai for assertions and Sinon for mocking.\n\nWhy it mattered: Became the de facto standard for Node for years.\n\n#### 2014 – Karma\n\nCreator: Angular team at Google (led by Vojta Jína).\n\nGood for: Running tests in real browsers automatically via CLI.\n\nWhy it mattered: Great for CI/CD and multi-browser support — part of Angular’s ecosystem.\n\n#### 2014–2015 – Jest\n\nCreator: Facebook (now Meta).\n\nFocus: “Zero-config” testing with snapshot testing, parallel runs, and built-in mocks.\n\nGood for: React and TypeScript apps.\n\nWhy it mattered: Became dominant due to simplicity and ecosystem integration.\n\nKey advantage: Great developer experience, fast feedback loop → perfect for shift-left workflows.\n\n#### 2017 – Cypress\n\nCreator: Brian Mann and the Cypress.io team.\n\nFocus: E2E testing with built-in time travel debugging.\n\nGood for: Testing browser apps visually and functionally, without Selenium.\n\nWhy it mattered: Simplified E2E and integrated seamlessly into CI/CD.\n\n#### 2019 – Playwright\n\nCreator: Microsoft (Andrey Lushnikov, ex-Google/Chrome DevTools).\n\nFocus: Modern, reliable cross-browser automation (Chromium, WebKit, Firefox).\n\nGood for: E2E testing, accessibility testing, PDF rendering, screenshot diffs.\n\nWhy it matters: Great reliability, full TypeScript support, and rich parallelization — becoming the new E2E standard.\n\n#### 2020s – Modern Tooling & Shift-Left Integration\n\nVitest (2021) – created by the Vite team, fast Jest-compatible unit testing.\n\nTesting Library (2018–ongoing) – Kent C. Dodds, focused on testing user behaviour over implementation details.\n\nCypress Component Testing / Playwright Test Runner (2022+) – merging E2E and component testing for React/Next.js apps.\n\nTrend: Testing integrated directly into build tools and CI from day one — true shift-left.\n"

    "content": "\n> Next.js is a full-stack JavaScript framework that brings together the power of React on the frontend with seamless backend capabilities, creating a unified developer experience.\n\n## Why we use it\n\nIt simplifies the process of building modern web applications by offering a complete toolkit. Its a complete platform for building modern web applications. Paired with Vercel, it offers an unparalleled development and deployment experience. It helps you skip the boring bits, focus on your product, and get it into users' phones faster.\n\nTraditional frontend frameworks like React are powerful, but they leave a lot of heavy lifting to the developer when it comes to routing, server-side rendering, static site generation, and deployment. This is where Next.js is better\n\n- Hybrid Rendering: Choose between static generation, server-side rendering, or client-side rendering on a per-page basis.\n- Built-in Routing: File-based routing makes navigation and structure intuitive.\n- API Routes: Define backend functions in the same codebase using the `/api` folder, removing the need for a separate backend server.\n- TypeScript Support: Native support for TypeScript enhances safety and developer experience.\n- Image Optimization: Next.js handles modern formats, resizing, and lazy loading automatically.\n- Internationalization: Built-in i18n support for multi-language sites.\n- Fast Refresh: Instant feedback on edits for a smoother development cycle.\n\n#### Solving Real-World Problems\n\nEvery real-world project ends up needing some combination of:\n\n- Route management\n- API endpoints\n- SEO configuration\n- Image handling\n- Page loading strategies\n- Secure deployment\n\nInstead of cobbling together 10 different libraries and configurations, Next.js gives you a coherent way to manage all of these within a single, maintainable framework. It saves enormous time on boilerplate setup and bug hunting.\n\n#### Why Vercel is good\n\nVercel is the platform behind Next.js, offering frictionless deployment and hosting for your Next.js projects. What makes it special:\n\n- One-click deployment from GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket\n- Global CDN for ultra-fast load times\n- Preview environments for every pull request\n- Built-in analytics, edge functions, and serverless capabilities\n- Zero-config hosting that just works\n\nNext.js + Vercel is one of the most productive and scalable stacks available today, whether you're building a personal portfolio or a full-scale SaaS product.\n\n[PrevNext prev=\"/work/expertise/javascript/vanilla-js\" next=\"/work/expertise/javascript/js-testing\"]\n\n## Case Study\n\nSituation\n\nThe company had a successful WordPress site that ranked well but had reached a ceiling. Its biggest issue was performance — page speed, particularly First Contentful Paint (FCP), was holding back further SEO growth.\n\nTask\n\nThe goal was to improve site performance to outpace competitors in search visibility by delivering significantly faster page loads.\n\nAction\n\nAfter analysing the existing setup, it became clear that server-rendered WordPress pages were the bottleneck. The solution was to rebuild the front-end using Next.js, leveraging its Static Site Generation (SSG) capability to pre-render pages as ultra-light static HTML. This gave users instant first paint while keeping dynamic data where needed through incremental builds and APIs.\n\nResult\n\nThe migration delivered dramatically faster load times, especially on mobile. Google’s Core Web Vitals improved across the board, and within weeks the site’s search rankings and visibility increased. The project became a clear demonstration of how technical SEO and modern JavaScript frameworks like Next.js can work together to drive measurable business results.\n"

Data formats varied — XML, serialized PHP, or proprietary APIs. Integration between systems was clunky.\n\n[PrevNext prev=\"/work/expertise/javascript/\" next=\"/work/expertise/javascript/nextjs\"]\n\nIn 2009, Ryan Dahl released Node.js, introducing JavaScript on the server. Suddenly, developers could use a single language across the full stack — a big productivity shift.\n\nBy around 2012–2013, npm and frameworks like Express.js matured, making Node a realistic choice for production. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), standardised by Douglas Crockford in the early 2000s and adopted widely by APIs by 2010, became the lingua franca of web data. REST APIs and later GraphQL solidified JSON as the universal format connecting frontend and backend.\n\nThat combination — Node + JSON + ubiquitous JavaScript — was transformative:\n\n- JavaScript devs could write backend logic without switching paradigms.\n- Data flowed naturally between client and server.\n- Tooling (npm, webpack, TypeScript) evolved into today’s unified ecosystem.\n\nSo for people coming from the WordPress/Drupal world, Node.js wasn’t just another backend — it represented a unification of the web stack, enabling real-time apps, server-side rendering, and microservices, all in JavaScript.\n"

    "content": "\n> In short, Hooks let React functions become stateful and reactive without classes\n\nAt a fundamental level, Hooks hook into React’s internal lifecycle and state system from within functional components.\n\nThey give functions access to capabilities that previously only class components had. State, context, lifecycle events, and refs, but in a simpler, composable way. Think of them as bridges between your component logic and React’s engine. Best used for:\n\n- useState / useReducer → managing local component state\n- useEffect → reacting to lifecycle events (mount, update, unmount)\n- useContext → consuming shared context data\n- useMemo / useCallback → optimising render performance\n- Custom hooks → encapsulating and reusing logic across components\n\n## In 2019 hooks solved two main problems:\n\n- State and lifecycle reuse — before Hooks, only class components could use state and lifecycle methods, making logic sharing clumsy (via HOCs or render props).\n\n- Complex component logic — class components often became bloated and hard to maintain.\n\nToday, Hooks are the standard for building React components — used for state, effects, context, refs, and custom logic reuse — effectively replacing most class components.\n\nExample:\n\n`useEffect` runs side effects — code that affects things outside React’s render cycle (e.g. fetching data, setting up subscriptions, updating the DOM). It executes after render.\n\n```\nuseEffect(() => {\n  fetchData();\n}, []);\n```\n\nuseMemo is for performance optimisation — it memoises an expensive computation so it’s only recalculated when its dependencies change. It runs during render, not after.\nExample:\n\n```\nconst value = useMemo(() => heavyCalc(data), [data]);\n```\n\nIn short:\n\n- useEffect → handles side effects\n- useMemo → caches pure calculations\n"

At its core, React popularised three key ideas:\n\n- Declarative UI — describing what the UI should look like, not how to manually manipulate the DOM.\n- Component architecture — breaking interfaces into reusable, composable building blocks.\n- Unidirectional data flow — making apps easier to reason about and debug.\n"

It started life scripting image rollovers in the ‘90s — and somehow ended up running banks and billion-dollar web apps.\n\nBy the early 2010s, the cracks were showing. Huge front-ends written in Vanilla JavaScript were turning into fragile spaghetti — a single mistyped property could break production. There was no safety net. No way to refactor confidently. No way to know what an object really looked like until runtime.\n\n[PrevNext next=\"/work/expertise/javascript/typescript/get-started\"]\n\nCreated at Microsoft by Anders Hejlsberg (the same mind behind C#), TypeScript was released in 2012 as a bold idea: add a type system to JavaScript, but keep it completely compatible.\n\nIt didn’t replace JS — it wrapped it with a layer of safety, structure, and intelligence. Suddenly, your editor could understand your code. You could autocomplete reliably, catch errors before running, and refactor without fear.\n\nAt first, the community was skeptical. Another Microsoft language? No thanks.\nBut when Angular 2 adopted TypeScript in 2016, everything changed. Soon React, Vue, Node, and Next.js developers were all using it — not because they had to, but because they didn’t want to go back.\n\nToday, TypeScript is how professional JavaScript gets written. It’s the balance between flexibility and reliability — the best of both worlds. JavaScript still runs the web. TypeScript just makes sure it doesn’t crash.\n\n#### ⚙️ Tech Summary\n\n**Created by:** Anders Hejlsberg, Microsoft  \n**First released:** 2012\n\n**Purpose:**  \nAdd optional static typing and modern tooling to large-scale JavaScript projects.\n\n**First major adopter:**  \nAngular 2 (2016)\n\n**Problem solved:**  \nFragile, untyped codebases that broke silently at runtime.\n\n**Today:**  \nWidely adopted across React, Vue, Node, and Next.js — the de facto language of modern JavaScript development.\n\n## Why TypeScript?\n\nThere was a time when using TypeScript felt optional — an extra layer for developers who liked type systems or came from Java or C#, but that time is over.\n\nToday, the question isn’t \"why use TypeScript?\" — it’s \"why would you develop without it?\"\n\nTypeScript catches the kinds of mistakes that JavaScript only tells you about at runtime. It prevents you from calling functions that don’t exist, passing wrong arguments, or forgetting to handle undefined. It turns invisible bugs into visible red lines in your editor — before you hit save.\n\n> That’s the difference between guessing and knowing.\n\nModern frameworks like Next.js, React, and Angular are built with TypeScript in mind.\nThe ecosystem — from libraries to IDEs — assumes it. You get stronger autocompletion, safer refactors, better API docs, and fewer production errors, all by writing the same code you were already writing — just with types.\n\nFor greenfield projects, starting without TypeScript makes no sense anymore. You’d be giving up type safety, editor intelligence, and long-term maintainability for no real gain. And since TypeScript compiles to JavaScript, there’s zero runtime penalty — just fewer bugs and better confidence.\n\nTypeScript isn’t a choice. It’s now how all serious JavaScript gets written.\n"

They let you describe a value that can be one of several types — a way to express this or that\n\n#### What a Union Type is\n\nA union type combines multiple possible types using the pipe (|) operator:\n\n```\nlet input: string | number;\n```\n\nThat means input can be either a string or a number — nothing else.\n\n```\ninput = \"hello\"; // ✅ OK\ninput = 42;      // ✅ OK\ninput = true;    // ❌ Error\n```\n\nSo TypeScript is saying: \"I accept any of these types, but no others.\"\n\nUnions let you model _real-world flexibility_ without losing type safety.\n\n```ts\nfunction formatId(id: string | number) {\n  return \\`#\\${id.toString()}\\`;\n}\n```\n\nYou can pass either a string or a number, and TypeScript ensures you handle both correctly.\n\n#### Type Narrowing\n\nWhen you use a union, TypeScript forces you to _narrow_ the type before using it in a specific way.\n\n```ts\nfunction printLength(value: string | string[]) {\n  if (typeof value === 'string') {\n    console.log(value.length); // value is string here\n  } else {\n    console.log(value.length); // value is string[] here\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe compiler automatically **tracks type branches** — this is called _control flow analysis_.\n\n#### Example with Literal Unions\n\nYou can use unions not just for _types_, but for _specific values_ too.\n\n```ts\ntype Direction = \"up\" | \"down\" | \"left\" | \"right\";\n\nfunction move(direction: Direction) {\n  console.log(\\`Moving \\${direction}\\`);\n}\n\nmove(\"up\"); // ✅\nmove(\"forward\"); // ❌ Error — not allowed\n```\n\nThis pattern is great for:\n\n- config values\n- API response states\n- React component variants  \n  (e.g. `variant: \"primary\" | \"secondary\"`)\n\n#### Combining Unions with Other Types\n\nUnions often work together with **intersections (`&`)** and **type aliases** to create rich models:\n\n```ts\ntype ErrorResult = { success: false; message: string };\ntype SuccessResult = { success: true; data: string };\n\ntype Result = ErrorResult | SuccessResult;\n\nfunction handle(result: Result) {\n  if (result.success) {\n    console.log(result.data); // TypeScript knows this is SuccessResult\n  } else {\n    console.log(result.message); // TypeScript knows this is ErrorResult\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThat’s called a **discriminated union** — one of the cleanest ways to model state machines in TypeScript.\n"

    "content": "\n## When JavaScript needs to be everywhere instantly\n\nIn modern web engineering, Vanilla JavaScript is often dismissed as old-school or under-powered. But at scale, especially across multiple domains or brands, it can be the smartest, fastest, and most maintainable choice. Imagine needing to deploy a single piece of client-side logic across dozens of independent websites — each with different:\n\n- Content management systems\n- CSS frameworks and design languages\n- Build pipelines and release cycles\n\nYet every site must receive the same injected content, analytics hooks, or A/B test framework — without conflicts, dependencies, or style collisions. That’s where a vanilla JavaScript delivery framework comes in.\n\nIt lets teams roll out shared functionality (recommendations, analytics, personalization, etc.) across dozens of independent domains with a single client update.\n\nVanilla JavaScript isn’t a step backward — it’s a strategic choice for products that need to operate everywhere, instantly, and invisibly.\n\nWhen performance, portability, and integration outweigh the need for complex UI frameworks, a handcrafted, dependency-free JavaScript delivery layer remains one of the most powerful tools in the modern engineer’s kit.\n\n[PrevNext prev=\"/work/expertise/javascript\" next=\"/work/expertise/javascript/node\"]\n\n#### Key Idea: The Client-Side Delivery Layer\n\nA delivery framework is a small, dependency-free JavaScript client that can be embedded on any page via:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.example.com/client/core.js\" async></script>\n```\n\nOnce loaded, it can:\n\n1. Fetch data from multiple APIs\n2. Inject dynamic content (using iframe or shadow DOM for isolation)\n3. Measure engagement and send metrics back to a central service\n4. Stay completely decoupled from the host site’s codebase\n\nThis approach allows large organizations to coordinate shared functionality without rewriting each site’s frontend.\n\n## Why Vanilla JavaScript?\n\nFrameworks like React, Vue, or Angular are powerful — but they come with:\n\n- Large runtime overhead\n- Complex build steps\n- Potential conflicts with other front-end code\n- SEO and performance penalties if not handled carefully\n\nBy contrast, pure ES module or plain script, on the other hand, offers several advantages:\n\n- Lightweight — No virtual DOM or library payload, resulting in faster first paint and smaller downloads.\n\n- Framework-agnostic — Works inside any CMS, static site, or web app without build-time integration.\n\n- Secure — Uses iframes or sandboxed DOM scopes to prevent style and script collisions.\n\n- Predictable — No dependency drift or version mismatches across environments.\n\n- Easy to distribute — A single CDN-hosted file can update functionality across every site instantly.\n\n#### iframes as a boundary layer\n\nThe simple iframe is still one of the best tools for safe cross-domain integration.  \nBy injecting self-contained frames, teams can:\n\n- Avoid CSS or JS collisions\n- Load dynamic experiences asynchronously\n- Enforce sandboxed permissions\n- Integrate with analytics or advertising systems that require isolation\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nconst frame = document.createElement('iframe');\nframe.src = 'https://cdn.example.com/widget.html';\nframe.style.border = '0';\nframe.width = '100%';\ndocument.body.appendChild(frame);\n```\n\n#### Trade-offs\n\nWhile minimalism offers power, it also requires discipline:\n\n- No JSX or component tree → UI logic must be hand-crafted\n- Versioning becomes crucial — the CDN script is global\n- Testing must ensure compatibility across browsers and sites\n- Inline styling and scoped CSS can get verbose\n\nYet for certain types of large, distributed systems, these trade-offs are well worth the simplicity.\n"

The sites worked, but keeping them fast, secure, and modern was becoming increasingly difficult. Each new feature required yet another plugin or fragile PHP tweak.\n\nRahul wasn’t looking to abandon WordPress; he simply wanted a way to **upgrade** his clients’ existing sites without reinventing the wheel.\n\n#### The Challenge\n\n- Aging WordPress themes and plugin dependencies\n- SEO and content tightly coupled to legacy templates\n- Clients expecting faster, more app-like performance\n- Limited ability to integrate modern front-end tooling (React, TypeScript, APIs)\n\nRahul needed a forward path that wouldn’t disrupt content workflows or require rebuilding two decades of investment.\n\n#### The Goldlabel Solution\n\nI introduced **Goldlabel** to Rahul in early 2025.  \nThe idea of treating WordPress as a _data source_ rather than something to replace immediately clicked.\n\nGoldlabel’s **server-side rendering (SSR)** via Next.js offered the high performance and SEO control his clients demanded, while preserving their existing databases and admin workflows.\n\nTogether, we built a modernization workflow:\n\n1. **Keep WordPress** as the CMS of record.\n2. **Expose content** through the WordPress REST API.\n3. **Render with Goldlabel** — React, TypeScript, Firestore, and CDN-cached SSR.\n4. **Deploy progressively** — site by site, section by section.\n\n#### Results (First 3 Months)\n\n- **6 websites modernized** between February and May 2025\n- Average **page-load time reduced by 65 %**\n- Improved **Core Web Vitals scores** across all migrated sites\n- Zero downtime or SEO disruption\n- Seamless editor experience — clients kept using `wp-admin`\n\n#### Roadmap\n\nEncouraged by the early success, Rahul’s team has a **roadmap of 30 more sites** to modernize by **Q1 2026**.  \nEach follows the same principle:\n\n> _Don’t rebuild. Extend._\n\nBy layering Goldlabel’s modern JavaScript architecture on top of WordPress, Rahul’s studio has unlocked a future-proof stack — one that serves existing clients better and positions the studio as a leader in modern web performance.\n\n#### Quote\n\n> “Our clients didn’t want a new CMS — they wanted faster, smoother sites.  \n> Goldlabel gave us a way to deliver that without starting over.”  \n> — **Rahul Sharma**, Founder, Shenzhen\n\n#### Key Takeaway\n\nGoldlabel provides agencies like Rahul’s with a **practical, low-risk path** to bring modern web capabilities to long-standing WordPress portfolios — proving that modernization doesn’t have to mean migration.\n"

The goals for the www app include:\n\n- Fast load times with statically generated pages at build time.\n- Tight control over metadata like titles, descriptions, and Open Graph information.\n- A responsive layout with easily navigable pages, prioritizing serious, no-nonsense content presentation without large animations or oversized images.\n\n#### Design and Development Goals\n\n1. SEO and Performance Optimization:\n\n   - Static generation for key pages (e.g., `/about`, `/services`, `/contact`).\n   - Metadata API in Next.js for defining page-level SEO (title, description, Open Graph data).\n   - Lighthouse audits to maintain high performance and accessibility scores.\n\n2. Layout and Styling:\n\n   - Components follow a structured approach with a server-rendered RootLayout that integrates MUI (Material UI) for consistent theming.\n   - The site avoids `use client` directives in layout components to ensure full compatibility with SSG and server-side rendering (SSR).\n   - Emotion (for CSS-in-JS) is integrated with critical CSS extraction during build time to prevent hydration issues.\n\n3. [Theme](/work/open-source/theme)\n\n   - A customizable MUI theme defines the color palette, typography, and component styles.\n   - MUI components like `Typography` and `Box` are used extensively in the layout and static components, such as the header and footer.\n\n4. Core Components:\n   - StaticHeader and StaticFooter provide consistent navigation and branding across pages.\n   - The footer includes links built with the Next.js `Link` component, styled using MUI's system (`sx` prop).\n\n#### Technical Setup\n\n- The monorepo is managed with a combination of Next.js, MUI, and Emotion.\n- The app is server-rendered for static content, ensuring minimal client-side hydration.\n- Emotion's SSR integration extracts critical styles during the static build to prevent styling mismatches between server and client.\n- The project supports rapid customization and updates through a shared component library and scalable page templates.\n\n#### Future Directions\n\n- Additional applications may be deployed under the Goldlabel Apps umbrella.\n- Features like dynamic data integration (e.g., Firebase, CMS) can enhance page content while preserving SEO and performance.\n- Expansion of static and dynamic content to further enrich the user experience.\n"

No forms, no sign-ups, just one click to unlock the content.\n\n### Examples\n\n[PageGrid thumbnails=\"yes\" pages=\"/work/cases/hertwig-auer, /balance/writing/not-here-to-fuck-spiders, /balance/writing/not-here-to-fuck-spiders/bez\"]\n\nIt still creates a user account on our firebase app, and should the user ever log out they can easily log back in by clicking the same button\n\nIn this way we can layer up the Paywall to include pages which are viewable if logged in, viewable only if the user has a Stripe subscription or viewable to only certain users.\n\nIn other words... Access control\n\n### More info\n\n> The Paywall cartridge is responsible for two key features: Authentication/Access Control and Pings\n\n- Authentication (Firebase Auth + `paywall` collection)\n  - User Management\n  - Community\n  - Passwords\n  - Avatars\n  - Geo\n  - Browsing History\n- Payment\n\n  - Membership\n\n- 🔒 Each signed-in user can read and write only their own Paywall document.\n- 🔒 Nobody (not even other authenticated users) can read or modify anyone else’s paywall data.\n\n> 🧑‍💻 Optionally, admins can access all (for billing dashboards, etc.).\n\nThe Paywall cartridge is responsible for two key features in Goldlabel Core: Authentication and Access Control System\n\n1. Authentication (Firebase Auth + `paywall` collection)\n2. Real‑time Visitor Tracking (Pings)\n\n#### 1. Authentication\n\nPaywall manages user authentication using Firebase Auth.  \nEvery user also has a corresponding document in the Firestore `paywall` collection that stores profile information and access level.\n\n#### Auth Data Model (`paywall` collection)\n\nEach document is keyed by `uid` and typically contains:\n\n```ts\n{\n  uid: string,                // Firebase UID\n  email: string,              // Authenticated email\n  displayName: string,        // Name to show in UI\n  avatar: string | null,      // URL to profile image\n  accessLevel: string,        // e.g. \"admin\", \"member\"\n  createdAt: Timestamp,\n  updatedAt: Timestamp\n}\n```\n\n#### Auth Flow\n\n- Sign Up  \n  Create a new Firebase Auth user, then create a matching doc in `paywall` with default metadata.\n\n- Sign In / Out  \n  Handled via Firebase Auth. Paywall listens to `onAuthStateChanged` and updates local state (via Uberedux).\n\n- Profile Updates  \n  Update both Firebase Auth (displayName, photoURL) and Firestore `paywall`.\n\n- Deletion  \n  Delete user from Firebase Auth and Firestore `paywall`.\n\n#### 2. Real‑Time Visitor Tracking (Pings)\n\nThe second function is similar to lightweight analytics.  \nEvery visitor (authenticated or not) continuously creates or updates a ping document in Firestore.\n\n#### Ping Data Model (`pings` collection)\n\n```ts\nexport interface TPing {\n  id: string;\n  hostname?: string;\n  pathname?: string;\n  browser?: string;\n  os?: string;\n  platform?: string;\n  model?: string;\n  modelCode?: string;\n  ip?: string;\n  organization?: string;\n  isp?: string;\n  country_name?: string;\n  country_code?: string;\n  city?: string;\n  state_prov?: string;\n  timezone_name?: string;\n  timezone_offset?: number;\n  latitude?: string;\n  longitude?: string;\n  vendor?: string;\n  isMobile?: boolean;\n  hardwareConcurrency?: number;\n  deviceMemory?: number;\n  created?: number;\n  updated?: number;\n  current_time?: string;\n  currency_symbol?: string;\n  currency_code?: string;\n  languages?: string;\n  history?: THistory[];\n  messages: TMessage[];\n  [key: string]: any;\n}\n```\n\n#### Ping Flow\n\n- Initialization\n\n  - On first load, generate a fingerprint (`@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs`).\n  - Fetch geo info from a server‑side geo lookup (`/api/geo`).\n\n- When Pings Are Sent\n\n  - On every route change.\n  - On an interval (e.g. every 10 seconds) while page is open.\n\n- What Happens\n  - `setDoc(doc(db, 'pings', fingerprint), { ... }, { merge: true })`\n  - If authenticated, `uid`, `displayName`, and `avatar` are included.\n\n#### Real‑Time Admin View\n\n- The Admin cartridge subscribes to the `pings` collection in real time.\n- An admin interface lists all visitors, showing:\n  - Current route\n  - Geo info\n  - Auth info (if available)\n  - Last seen time\n\n#### Messaging Visitors\n\nAdmins can send a message to a visitor:\n\n- Update the `message` field on that visitor’s ping document.\n- Only the visitor with that fingerprint sees it (via their live subscription).\n\n#### Security & Considerations\n\n- Firestore Rules\n\n  - `auth` collection: only admins or owner can update their own doc.\n  - `pings` collection: allow anonymous writes for own fingerprint; only admins can send `message`\n\n- Privacy\n  - No cookies; fingerprints are anonymous unless user is authenticated\n\n#### Dependencies\n\n- [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)\n- [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)\n- [`@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs`](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs)\n- GeoIP service (e.g. [ipapi.co](https://ipapi.co) or a custom `/api/geo` route)\n"

Shortcodes let you drop small, purposeful commands directly into your markdown or content files — things like grids, cards, embeds, or custom UI elements — and have them render as fully interactive components on the page.\n\nThis gives editors a clean, readable way to compose rich layouts without touching JSX. Developers define the shortcodes; content authors use them; Goldlabel resolves them at render time. It’s a lightweight but powerful bridge between content and components, designed to keep your pages flexible, expressive, and easy to maintain.\n"

Nobody wants that.\n\n[GitHub url=\"https://github.com/javascript-pro/core/tree/master/gl-core/cartridges/Uberedux\" label=\"Uberedux\"]\n\nUberedux is a simple, zero-config wrapper around Redux. It plugs cleanly into how the app already works and gives you the global state access you need without boilerplate or fuss. There’s nothing clever here — and that’s the point. Uberedux is fast, familiar, and already done for you.\n\nIf you've used Redux before, you already know how to use Uberedux. If you haven't, don't worry — the basics are dead simple. Actions update the store. Components subscribe to the parts they care about. That’s it.\n\nWe’ve trimmed the fat: no reducers to wire up manually, no sprawling folder trees, no indirection. Instead, you get a single useSlice() hook that gives you what you need, when you need it — whether that's in a form field, a route guard, or a floating modal.\n\nUberedux isn’t trying to win design awards. It's just here to work — cleanly, quietly, and consistently across your app. No surprises. No rewrites. Just state management that stays out of your way.\n"
