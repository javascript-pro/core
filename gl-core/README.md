## Goldlabel Core.

The real meat and veg of Goldlabel is here. Copy it to the src directory of your React App and wire it up a bit to make it work. You might also need some assets in the public folder and possibly fome of the Node api files

In due course, this will be a publically available library on npm with a name like @goldlabel_apps/core
