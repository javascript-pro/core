Match to Senior Guidewire Digital Developer – NFU Mutual

I bring over 20 years of fullstack JavaScript experience, with a strong focus on React. I’ve led frontend teams delivering enterprise-grade SPAs using React, REST APIs, and modern tooling — often within tightly regulated or insurance-adjacent environments.
While I haven’t worked directly with Guidewire’s PolicyCenter, CustomerEngage, or Edge APIs, I’ve been building REST integrations since the days of XML over HTTP. Today, working with JSON-based REST endpoints is second nature. Given that the Guidewire frontend relies on React and communicates via REST, this plays directly to my strengths.
I’m used to ramping up quickly on large systems, documenting as I go, and collaborating with stakeholders across engineering, business, and operations. I'm confident that I could pick up Guidewire’s patterns fast and begin contributing effectively to the Digital team.
In short: while I don’t have hands-on Guidewire experience yet, I have exactly the kind of frontend and integration background needed to support and extend a system like this — especially on the React side.
