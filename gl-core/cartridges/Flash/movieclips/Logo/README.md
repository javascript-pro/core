## 🚀 OK, here's the crux

We've got a log which has 2 colors. The colours are layered, so the top colour is the main one. The middle layer is inbetween that colour and the darkest, which is the third layer

The logo consists of 6 MovieClips, the lightning bolt and the 5 letters F,L,A,S,H 

They are composed into a clip called Logo, which makes it easy to include it anywhere 


That and the ActionScript Class LogoAS.ts
