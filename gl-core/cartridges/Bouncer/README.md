Prevent public rendering of the page content by checking the `bouncer` flag in the frontmatter and conditionally returning the `<Bouncer />` component instead.

### ✅ Confirmation

> If a markdown file includes `bouncer: true` in its frontmatter, and your Next.js catchall route component only returns the `<Bouncer />` component in that case, none of the content (markdown or metadata) will be publicly rendered in the static output, as long as you do not accidentally pre-render it elsewhere.

### ✅ What to Change in `Page`

Update the return statement in your `Page` component like so:

```tsx
if (frontmatter.bouncer === true) {
  return <Bouncer />;
}
```

Insert this right before you return the full `Core` component with `<ReactMarkdown>{content}</ReactMarkdown>`.

### ✅ Example Modification

Here's the key modification inside your `Page` function (just before the final `return`):

```tsx
if (frontmatter.bouncer === true) {
  return <Bouncer />;
}
```

Full excerpt for clarity:

```tsx
// ...
for (const filePath of tryPaths) {
  try {
    if (fs.existsSync(filePath)) {
      const fileContent = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
      const parsed = matter(fileContent);
      content = parsed.content;
      frontmatter = parsed.data;
      break;
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to load markdown for', slugPath, error);
  }
}

// ✨ Restrict access for bouncer-protected pages
if (frontmatter.bouncer === true) {
  return <Bouncer />;
}

const type = 'page';
const navItem = findNavItem(slugPath, globalNav[0]);
const title = navItem?.title || 'Goldlabel';
// ...
```

### ✅ Security and SSG Note

Since this logic happens at runtime on the client-side, and all pages are statically built ahead of time, it's critical that:

- You're not leaking any sensitive content in the `.md` file itself — the content still exists in the public `markdown` folder and gets bundled into the static output at build time.
- You don't use `getStaticProps` or expose any metadata or markdown content related to bouncer-protected pages elsewhere (e.g. global nav showing excerpts).

If that's a concern, you could:

- Move protected markdown files out of the `public` folder into a private `/content` folder,
- Load them via a server-only API or through middleware logic for SSR in the future.

---

### ✅ TL;DR

- ✅ Yes, this approach will hide markdown content from rendering if `bouncer: true`.
- ✅ Just return `<Bouncer />` early in the `Page` component.
- ⚠️ But be aware: since the markdown file still exists in `/public/markdown`, it can technically still be accessed if someone knows the filename unless you prevent that via route rules or move them out of `public`.

Let me know if you’d like to move `markdown` into a private location and still keep SSG.
